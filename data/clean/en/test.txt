you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer.
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves.
there is a lady, it seems, a mrs.
you judge very properly, said mr.
they travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on the road, reached longbourn by dinnertime the next day.
bennet, that you should be so ready to think your own children silly.
but as to your other objection, i am afraid it will hardly hold good.
darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder; and when at last mr.
it was a rational scheme, to be sure!
collins, in describing the civility of mr.
certainly, replied elizabeth, there are such people, but i hope i am not one of them.
who could have done less for her?
take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one.
why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.
such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret.
there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping, i dare say.
don t keep coughing so, kitty, for heaven s sake!
and, above all things, keep mr.
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; mr.
indeed, replied elizabeth, i am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.
all this was acknowledged to mrs.
a thorough, determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.
it is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married, continued her mother; but at the same time, mr.
norris and others have secured, i believe, a considerable party for it.
darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible.
indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not.
at present we have nothing to guide us.
the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow.
but when the gentlemen entered, jane was no longer the first object; miss bingley s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.
lydia declared herself satisfied.
i must confess myself surprised by your application; i did not expect it from you.
collins, the visit to hunsford, the derbyshire tour fit in after the same unostentatious, but masterly fashion.
but i will no longer importune my young cousin.
wherever you and jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say, three very silly sisters.
his attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.
she is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.
fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.
he has given in all his debts; i hope at least he has not deceived us.
if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go.
he seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy.
no, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if i have very good luck, i may meet with another mr.
we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.
i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.
pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night.
she cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving wickham.
i declare, after all, there is no enjoyment like reading!
we had better go into the avenue.
and of your infliction, cried elizabeth, with energy; you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty.
i must think your language too strong in speaking of both, replied jane; and i hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together.
darcy, to be treating his father s favourite in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for.
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of mr.
but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them.
when she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.
such very superior dancing is not often seen.
oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain.
the supposition did not pain her.
too much, i am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for i ought not to have mentioned the subject?
it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution.
he has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.
they are gone off together from brighton.
have you not heard me say, that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship s carriage was ready to take them all home.
collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl.
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did january and february pass away.
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr.
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, elizabeth s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?
well, then, supposing them to be in london they may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose.
that will not do for a compliment to darcy, caroline, cried her brother, because he does not write with ease.
others of the party were now applied to.
he has some friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he deserves.
she inquired after his sister, but could do no more.
i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for i am fond of superior society; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas.
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other.
darcy replied, with great intrepidity, miss elizabeth bennet.
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.
had you then persuaded yourself that i should?
nay, when i read a letter of his, i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham, much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law.
if you ll believe me, i did not once put my foot out of doors, though i was there a fortnight.
i hope you have destroyed the letter.
he then went away, and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.
bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to mr.
had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place?
bingley never stirs without him.
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections.
he has a very satirical eye, and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself, i shall soon grow afraid of him.
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.
darcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.
lizzy is not a bit better than the others: and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane, nor half so good-humoured as lydia.
she answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist the temptation, added, when you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance.
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment.
collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight, but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction.
she had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome.
lizzy, said he, what are you doing?
her hair so untidy, so blowzy!
he was then, he said, on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her.
i know of nobody that is coming, i am sure, unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in; and i hope my dinners are good enough for her.
hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room.
but let me advise you to think better of it.
and, after all, what is the good of seeking for the reason of charm?
their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme.
do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?
that such a consequence as this should ensue, you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts.
i ask only a comfortable home; and, considering mr.
it has been a very agreeable day, said miss bennet to elizabeth.
she answered him with cold civility.
i, who have valued myself on my abilities!
lizzy, my dear, i want to speak to you.
wickham s attention was caught; and after observing mr.
and in that sense miss austen certainly was one.
hope was over, entirely over; and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort.
oh, what hours of transport we shall spend!
you begin to comprehend me, do you?
oh, i am not at all afraid of her dying.
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her affectionate heart.
though i thought it would be very good fun if i was.
it was to this effect: since writing the above, dearest lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well.
with a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round.
colonel forster will, i dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head.
bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.
elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.
our distress, my dear lizzy, is very great.
bennet was not so well pleased with it.
after sitting a little while with jane, on miss bingley s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour.
they descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned.
i assure you, i feel it exceedingly, said lady catherine; i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do.
bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.
lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but mr.
this room was my late master s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then.
after welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, is not this nice?
you have employed your time much better.
anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.
she had better have stayed at home, cried elizabeth: perhaps she meant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one s neighbours.
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.
with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.
that will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him.
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.
yes, sir; but i do not know when that will be.
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.
that they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice!
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that mr.
yet it is hard, she sometimes thought, that this poor man cannot come to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation!
philips, appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use to the late mr.
after sitting for a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to elizabeth, i hope you are well, miss bennet.
i have suspected it some time, but i am now convinced.
elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.
of having another daughter married to mr.
but think no more of the letter.
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long mr.
i rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen.
nay, cried bingley, this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning.
he took the hint and soon began with, this seems a very comfortable house.
gardiner s business, on her arrival, was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.
their reception at home was most kind.
wickham began the subject himself.
miss bennet paused a little, and then replied, surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr.
bennet s consent should be asked in the course of the evening: elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother s.
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.
you are charmingly grouped, and appear to uncommon advantage.
he came down to see the place this was invitation enough.
you know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it.
darcy sends you all the love in the world that can be spared from me.
and what claims has lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?
now, said she, that this first meeting is over, i feel perfectly easy.
i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies.
women fancy admiration means more than it does.
now i have got some news for you, said lydia, as they sat down to table.
collins, but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter, to whom i have related the affair.
it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried.
bennet s anguish over the entail.
i dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.
and, my dear jane, i never saw you look in greater beauty.
i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley, or admit his society in town.
her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.
upon my word, i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself.
mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.
however, i did not hear above one word in ten, for i was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear wickham.
bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came, as usual, to spend the christmas at longbourn.
who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival?
i know your disposition, lizzy.
she was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr.
your conjecture is totally wrong, i assure you.
there was no help for it, however.
neither could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which mr.
family pride, and filial pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this.
it is very unlucky; but as i have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.
you are very cruel, said her sister, you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment.
such amiable qualities must speak for themselves.
susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough.
bennet; and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before.
philips, who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade.
when you have killed all your own birds, mr.
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.
i believe i have now told you everything.
i did not know before, continued bingley, immediately, that you were a studier of character.
i perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia.
nothing is false; nothing is superfluous.
miss bingley s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr.
bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for lydia s interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but mr.
to assure you in the most animated language.
she was roused from her seat and her reflections, by someone s approach; and, before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by wickham.
her ease and good spirits increased.
he is also handsome, replied elizabeth, which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can.
darcy, i am a very selfish creature, and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours.
you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room, said mr.
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be.
gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.
on applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.
she talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr.
if such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy!
bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on.
there was one part, especially the opening of it, which i should dread your having the power of reading again.
wickham s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds: i should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.
she began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them.
yes, replied darcy, who could contain himself no longer, but that was only when i first knew her; for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.
i dare say you will find him very agreeable.
elizabeth hesitated; but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.
its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned.
where does discretion end, and avarice begin?
between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.
catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under lydia s guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing.
she would be in nobody s way, you know, in that part of the house.
darcy, as well as elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.
we all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.
darcy, looking at the eldest miss bennet.
he bore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr.
in respect of her art generally, mr.
he spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride.
he owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.
my dearest lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr.
but jane could think with certainty on only one point, that mr.
their table was superlatively stupid.
her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for mr.
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.
in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!
gardiner, with occasional help from elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.
wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr.
implacable resentment is a shade in a character.
oh, you mean jane, i suppose, because he danced with her twice.
i do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr.
you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.
an hour, however, saw the whole completed; and mr.
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.
will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again?
the earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence.
if he fears me, why come hither?
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good.
i desire you will do no such thing.
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment.
jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.
you cannot refuse to dance, i am sure, when so much beauty is before you.
gardiner declared his willingness, and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.
she performed her part, indeed, without much graciousness, but mrs.
jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.
to jane herself, she exclaimed, there could be no possibility of objection, all loveliness and goodness as she is!
philips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton.
it is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.
darcy s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister s sufferings.
but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?
bennet to her daughters room, in her dressing-gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out, my dear jane, make haste and hurry down.
elizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeing the lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.
we will be down as soon as we can, said jane; but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago.
darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections.
why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear.
darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.
and pray when am i to wish you joy?
he acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.
were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express.
you will not, i hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter s favour, without having paid yourself and mr.
could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia s note to his wife?
it was only said, lately, george wickham, esq., to miss lydia bennet, without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.
collins s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest.
elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention.
my dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.
i never heard of such a thing.
bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth, i am glad you are come back, lizzy.
elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying.
but they did pass away, and mr.
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the north.
elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion.
no man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.
a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe.
as to art, if she has never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree which makes the false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive.
his plan did not vary on seeing them.
bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs.
he does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from mr.
after pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read.
but if he does it any more, i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about.
wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr.
he only told me what i have now told you.
bennet half opened the door and called out, lizzy, my dear, i want to speak with you.
darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do.
i believe, ma am, i may safely promise you never to dance with him.
if i had been able, said she, to carry my point in going to brighton with all my family, this would not have happened: but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her.
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.
she had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge.
give my love to colonel forster.
darcy s letter to lady catherine was in a different style, and still different from either was what mr.
this invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married.
hurst, running away without telling us that you were coming out.
his appearance was greatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.
darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister s refusal must have given him.
he walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great!
in my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either.
but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there.
her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it.
i only want to think you perfect, and you set yourself against it.
darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him.
had elizabeth s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort.
elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits.
elizabeth was determined; nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.
jane listened with astonishment and concern: she knew not how to believe that mr.
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and mr.
she followed him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!
putting away the letter immediately, and forcing a smile, she said, i did not know before that you ever walked this way.
as long as she stays there, it is all very well.
the elevation of his feelings.
you supposed more than really existed.
darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?
she blushed, and jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.
gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from colonel forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.
you promised me to insist upon her marrying him.
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
she does not touch what she did not feel herself called to paint; i am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not feel herself called to touch.
she mentioned this to her friend, miss lucas.
but with such a father and mother, and such low connections, i am afraid there is no chance of it.
bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required.
his debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!
and there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself.
on the strength of darcy s regard, bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion.
can you, yourself, lizzie, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?
there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men.
bennet was likely to live; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever mr.
but she is very young: she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity.
darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand.
darcy has never seen the view.
there can be no love in all this.
well, he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now.
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object.
shall you like to have such a brother?
his temptation is not adequate to the risk.
while they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.
why should he have it more than anybody else?
i cannot think so very ill of wickham.
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed.
i knew nothing at all of lady catherine s connections.
darcy, and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it.
bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton.
the hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance.
that is not an unnatural surmise, said fitzwilliam; but it is lessening the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly.
collins should be able to procure any woman s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?
bingley s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.
darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.
let me first see how he behaves, said she; it will then be early enough for expectation.
his friend had left him that morning for london, but was to return home in ten days time.
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, i cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine.
it was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that wickham s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was.
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her.
lady catherine s great attentions to mrs.
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.
when (to take the present book only) mr.
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes.
darcy improves on acquaintance.
at that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion.
this son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for.
had she found jane in any apparent danger, mrs.
i could not have parted with you, my lizzy, to anyone less worthy.
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr.
it is natural that obligation should be felt, and if i could feel gratitude, i would now thank you.
darcy, she cried: i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.
bennet, and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman.
two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.
collins was to attend them, at the request of mr.
but another spectator letter that of the damsel of fourteen who wishes to marry mr.
though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.
the power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance.
collins; but i do not think there would have been any fun in it.
does he know his real character?
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic.
i suspected as much, replied elizabeth.
that will make your ladyship s situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me.
we all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.
we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.
but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world, replied darcy.
bingley himself, elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before mr.
collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday.
but their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.
your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.
i beg your pardon, replied miss bingley, turning away with a sneer.
i have done with you from this very day.
he did not talk to me of his own arts, said fitzwilliam, smiling.
let me do it without further loss of time.
but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side, said jane.
you are not going to be missish, i hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent.
their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago.
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.
lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in bingley s way.
my manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, i assure you.
with them he is remarkably agreeable.
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as i have given above.
i am not likely to leave kent for some time.
what made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?
darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend i ever had; and i can never be in company with this mr.
darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.
elizabeth s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view.
his reception, however, was of the most flattering kind.
such an openness and gentleness in his manner.
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.
all that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the london road.
darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.
we dine at rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home.
it had come with a fare from london; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked, he meant to make inquiries at clapham.
his behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire.
darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property.
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard, his claims on mr.
i do not mind his not talking to mrs.
but wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour.
i think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to more than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest merit, the choicest gift, of the novelist.
it settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.
their mutual affection will steady them; and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten.
but does lydia know nothing of this?
it is amazing to me, said bingley, how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.
something, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.
his manners are very different from his cousin s.
bennet thus began the projected conversation: oh, mr.
all that i can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry.
in that case he would return no more.
my father s opinion of me does me the greatest honour; and i should be miserable to forfeit it.
indeed, you are mistaken, madam; i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here.
gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr.
oh, do not repeat what i then said.
collins on his return highly gratified mrs.
there is something a little stately in him, to be sure, replied her aunt; but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.
but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising.
but tell me, what did you come down to netherfield for?
maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.
let me write for you, said jane, if you dislike the trouble yourself.
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner.
she is all affability and condescension, and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over.
well, lizzy, continued her mother, soon afterwards, and so the collinses live very comfortable, do they?
he found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty.
i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection.
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.
she directly replied, you need not be frightened.
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manœuvre of mrs.
bennet s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.
but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult.
we acted with the best intentions.
i am not qualified to form one.
if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh.
but before they heard again from mr.
do you play and sing, miss bennet?
it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to mr.
they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds.
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet i think it is well expressed.
that they might have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger.
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless.
let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance.
i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr.
for she only came, i suppose, to tell us the collinses were well.
your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why i come.
well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: i thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them.
your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct, i am sure.
i am determined never to speak of it again i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more.
at length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house.
but the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me.
i know you will contrive it all.
gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to london at the same time that mr.
elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly.
i do not trust my own partiality.
her daughter, miss de bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.
it cannot be done too much; and when i next write to her, i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.
when a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.
collins, in return for his last.
bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces.
when they all removed to brighton, therefore, you had no reason, i suppose, to believe them fond of each other?
she told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.
it is a circumstance which darcy of course could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady s family it would be an unpleasant thing.
let us hope for better things.
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it.
i am astonished, said miss bingley, that my father should have left so small a collection of books.
some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr.
bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.
darcy before they had known anything of the matter.
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs.
but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us?
cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; and i am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable.
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.
when they ascended the steps to the hall, maria s alarm was every moment increasing, and even sir william did not look perfectly calm.
