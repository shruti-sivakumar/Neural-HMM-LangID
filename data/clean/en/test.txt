an express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from colonel forster, to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with wickham!
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted.
by tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and mr.
but now that my dear uncle is come, i hope everything will be well.
this is the only point, i flatter myself, on which we do not agree.
perhaps i am not doing her justice.
collins then returned to elizabeth.
it was a rational scheme, to be sure!
darcy could be so unworthy of mr.
perhaps that is not possible for anyone.
who could have done less for her?
it was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from jane.
he wrote last week to hurry my return.
our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia s character.
well, much good may it do them!
when is your next ball to be, lizzy?
in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before.
but jane knows, as well as i do, what wickham really is.
bennet as much as possible, saying not much to elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.
but you will know it, when i have told you what happened the very next day.
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.
his disposition must be dreadful.
he has some friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he deserves.
the elopement of lydia and wickham is not, like that of crawford and mrs.
some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me.
no one but jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation.
but you are always giving her the preference.
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected.
collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship s praise into his own hands.
he then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.
bennet and her daughters then departed, and elizabeth returned instantly to jane, leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr.
but if you are really innocent and ignorant, i must be more explicit.
spectator, and in jane austen s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was masculine.
collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with mr.
the officers will find women better worth their notice.
while there was an officer in meryton, they would flirt with him; and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn, they would be going there for ever.
and there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much.
but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you.
she is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father.
it was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.
it was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.
if i can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too.
she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him.
i hope you will drink to our good journey.
he must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on.
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day.
she then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two.
and this, cried darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, is your opinion of me!
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect.
bingley s being imposed on than that mr.
pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen!
bennet s heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.
she danced four dances with him at meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times.
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.
when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner s in town so much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.
she smiled, but made no answer.
too much, i am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for i ought not to have mentioned the subject?
we neither of us perform to strangers.
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.
when i consider, she added, in a yet more agitated voice, that i might have prevented it!
its completion depended on others.
they then sat down, and when her inquiries after rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.
it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh s family.
the journey would, moreover, give her a peep at jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.
to jane herself, she exclaimed, there could be no possibility of objection, all loveliness and goodness as she is!
surprise was the least of all her feelings on this development.
and of your infliction, cried elizabeth, with energy; you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty.
his most particular friend, you see by jane s account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.
he leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.
when you have killed all your own birds, mr.
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away.
i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner.
for my part, i am inclined to believe it all mr.
a lady s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment.
elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits.
had you then persuaded yourself that i should?
nay, when i read a letter of his, i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham, much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law.
and then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it.
i hope you have destroyed the letter.
gardiner thought of him, and mrs.
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her, the worth of each was eclipsed by mr.
he was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey.
she will drop the acquaintance entirely.
bingley s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.
it will be her turn soon to be teased, said miss lucas.
cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; and i am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable.
darcy; but let me not interrupt you, sir.
you take delight in vexing me.
he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship, replied elizabeth, with emphasis, and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life.
perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.
bennet was really in a most pitiable state.
the others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his figure; but elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence.
lizzy, said he, what are you doing?
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.
it was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.
well, i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr.
hurst was observing their game.
but let me advise you to think better of it.
but to live with and to marry, i do not know that any one of the four can come into competition with elizabeth.
their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme.
you refuse, then, to oblige me.
from elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent.
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match.
i am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection.
my feelings will not be repressed.
but vanity, not love, has been my folly.
he sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits.
you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr.
in respect of her art generally, mr.
elizabeth, to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation.
let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.
it does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.
i would go and see her if i could have the carriage.
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her affectionate heart.
her ease and good spirits increased.
so imprudent a match on both sides!
her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for mr.
the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning s impatience.
his sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.
elizabeth s astonishment was beyond expression.
my poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room.
his daughter s request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north, received at first an absolute negative.
she is a great deal too ill to be moved.
they followed her into the dining-parlour.
his attachment to rosings certainly increases.
collins, i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship s concurrence.
bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon.
oh, yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!
i do not think it is very pretty; but i thought i might as well buy it as not.
elizabeth immediately began playing again.
and on the gentlemen s approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper, the men shan t come and part us, i am determined.
he meant, i believe, replied jane, to go to epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if anything could be made out from them.
it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing, said bingley.
my father and mother believe the worst, but i cannot think so ill of him.
it would be nothing; i could see him with perfect indifference; but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.
she was ashamed to think how much.
this was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas.
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds?
bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.
bingley comes, my dear, said mrs.
darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father s active superintendence; and when, immediately before my father s death, mr.
bennet, delighted to speak to a lady catherine.
if my children are silly, i must hope to be always sensible of it.
not at all, was her answer; but, depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it.
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn.
i came to you without a doubt of my reception.
you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.
about the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.
you have only proved by this, cried elizabeth, that mr.
collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.
two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.
and then when we came away it was such fun!
a clear ten thousand per annum.
the general prejudice against mr.
well, cried her mother, it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle?
bennet s consent should be asked in the course of the evening: elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother s.
were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
their powers of conversation were considerable.
a single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year.
he comes down on thursday, at the latest, very likely on wednesday.
darcy sends you all the love in the world that can be spared from me.
but, really, i know not what to say.
yes, very indifferent, indeed, said elizabeth, laughingly.
yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.
bingley s conduct to design, said elizabeth; but, without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error and there may be misery.
you thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared!
there was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him.
bingley to do, he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine s visit.
here again i cannot go with the objectors.
it would have suited me in every respect.
long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: i like them prodigiously.
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.
there can be no love in all this.
darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection.
it is very unlucky; but as i have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.
not one party, or scheme, or anything!
philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with her longbourn nieces.
collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.
i know your disposition, lizzy.
i should be sorry, indeed, if it were.
darcy replied, with great intrepidity, miss elizabeth bennet.
elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply.
darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.
it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy; but she is too much like her brother, very, very proud.
but i knew i should persuade you at last.
we all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.
he was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.
and who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them?
let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.
philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before.
were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as elizabeth half expected mr.
if she heard me, it was by good luck, for i am sure she did not listen.
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.
she knew not how to support herself, and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour.
wickham began the subject himself.
bennet would have stirred the fire), when mr.
how much sooner one tires of anything than of a book!
miss bennet s lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening she was his settled choice.
bennet instantly answered, oh dear!
we were always good friends, and now we are better.
i am sure my sisters must all envy me.
but that is one great difference between us.
i am sorry, exceedingly sorry, replied darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.
do let me ask my partner to introduce you.
collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
and i think you will agree with me, in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece s.
elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.
collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear.
their mutual affection will steady them; and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten.
bennet s invention was again at work to get everybody away from him and her daughter.
but think no more of the letter.
and they are really to be married!
she began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady s attention which could furnish her with an occasion for dictating to others.
they talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of everything but himself; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs.
wickham s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to lydia s for him.
darcy, and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it.
no, i thank you, she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken.
but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather s death made her mistress of this fortune?
bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.
darcy s explanation, by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what jane had lost.
darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me.
darcy, as well as elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.
bingley called again, and alone.
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.
darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them.
it is at least remarkable that in two very short periods of writing one of about three years, and another of not much more than five she executed six capital works, and has not left a single failure.
it is natural that obligation should be felt, and if i could feel gratitude, i would now thank you.
bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.
i can much more easily believe mr.
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation.
lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.
elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them.
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy.
and his behaviour, so strikingly altered, what could it mean?
she answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.
darcy s sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road.
i declare i do not know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a sunday evening, when he has nothing to do.
and yours, he replied, with a smile, is wilfully to misunderstand them.
robinson s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest?
in my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either.
i do not think we were speaking at all.
his temptation is not adequate to the risk.
you see on what a footing we are.
it is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill.
collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him.
now, said she, that this first meeting is over, i feel perfectly easy.
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.
bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?
i have found out, said he, by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation to my patroness.
he had rather hoped that all his wife s views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear.
elizabeth was determined; nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.
she felt that she had no business at pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.
bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield.
collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater.
when she thought of her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr.
they both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open, and their visitor entered.
my dearest lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr.
he sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room.
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing.
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening.
but surely, said she, i may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars, without his perceiving me.
two obstacles of the five being thus removed, mrs.
society, i own, is necessary to me.
bennet, as he folded up the letter.
darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but in vain.
my youngest of all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man, who, i believe, will soon become a part of the family.
nay, if you are so serious about it, i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled.
bingley s name had been last mentioned between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, his mind was not very differently engaged.
if you will thank me, he replied, let it be for yourself alone.
collins s offer was now nearly at an end, and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.
i am going to gretna green, and if you cannot guess with who, i shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world i love, and he is an angel.
darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.
she accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost.
elizabeth soon heard from her friend, and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been: that it should be equally unreserved was impossible.
she has known him only a fortnight.
bennet; and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before.
compared with some families, i believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means.
i was ready to die of laughter.
i am astonished, said miss bingley, that my father should have left so small a collection of books.
to the little town of lambton, the scene of mrs.
the carriage was sent to meet them at , and they were to return in it by dinnertime.
it is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.
wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony.
well, cried elizabeth, have it as you choose.
but with miss austen the myriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.
elizabeth, equally next to jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.
as it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it.
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.
with great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic.
collins by jane s introduction of him.
your cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings.
bennet s schemes for this day were ineffectual.
lizzy, when you first read that letter, i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now.
that is very true, replied elizabeth, and i could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.
bennet gone away, and i know he will fight wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all?
bingley is most unaffectedly modest.
at night she opened her heart to jane.
cried elizabeth when she had finished it.
darcy s letter to lady catherine was in a different style, and still different from either was what mr.
forster should not ask me as well as lydia, said she, though i am not her particular friend.
we had better go into the avenue.
both changed colour, one looked white, the other red.
but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham?
bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him.
but in matters of greater weight, i may suffer from the want of money.
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house, whichever it might be, where mr.
with assumed tranquillity he then replied, i have no wish of denying that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that i rejoice in my success.
wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.
in every view it is unaccountable!
to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!
elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father s behaviour as a husband.
the evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of jane and elizabeth.
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by miss bingley, i can guess the subject of your reverie.
interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other.
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.
it is not quite a week since they left brighton.
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.
do you certainly leave kent on saturday?
you will not be fit to be seen when you get there.
collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it.
you supposed more than really existed.
you will be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
only think of its being three months, she cried, since i went away: it seems but a fortnight, i declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time.
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brighton.
not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did mrs.
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said, you are mistaken, mr.
for if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which only genius knows.
in nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show more affection than she feels.
if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside, cried bingley, it would not make them one jot less agreeable.
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax mr.
wickham s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds: i should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of mr.
having said thus much, i feel no doubt of your secrecy.
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.
in the first place, replied mr.
it is such a spur to one s genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind.
charlotte herself was tolerably composed.
susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough.
it was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount, and elizabeth silently consented.
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did january and february pass away.
well, my comfort is, i am sure jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done.
as i did the other day, said elizabeth, with a conscious smile; very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that.
do anything rather than marry without affection.
i cannot think so very ill of wickham.
elizabeth s courage did not fail her.
miss darcy s praise occupied the chief of it.
why should they not go on to scotland, if that had been the case?
every park has its beauty and its prospects; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as mr.
vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another.
he smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.
and you saw the old housekeeper, i suppose?
with these rooms i might have now been familiarly acquainted!
bennet, i am quite delighted with him.
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.
i ask only a comfortable home; and, considering mr.
so, lizzy, said he, one day, your sister is crossed in love, i find.
she became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it.
she had ventured only one glance at darcy.
he should be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.
i know it all; that the young man s marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle.
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr.
there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us.
it was all pride and insolence.
indeed, fantastic as it may seem, i should put miss austen as near to swift in some ways, as i have put her to addison in others.
with your good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others!
for i dare not hope, he continued, in a lower and more serious tone, that he is improved in essentials.
when first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.
bennet had no turn for economy; and her husband s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.
bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected.
this is an evening of wonders, indeed!
lady catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way.
while sir william was with them, mr.
the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation.
her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.
she has one only daughter, the heiress of rosings, and of very extensive property.
the necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.
collins to join his daughters in their walk; and mr.
bennet, she took an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at work her fools and her mean persons.
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage.
i daresay you believed it; but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity.
kitty and me were to spend the day there, and mrs.
perhaps it would have been better, replied her sister.
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate.
that is the most unforgiving speech, said elizabeth, that i ever heard you utter.
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?
lizzy, said her father, i have given him my consent.
i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr.
do you prefer reading to cards?
how wonderfully these sort of things occur!
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable.
bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party.
is nothing due to me on that score?
she then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley.
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking.
i am thinking of what you have been telling me, said she.
i am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.
i am glad i brought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another band-box!
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd!
i had narrowly observed her, during the two visits which i had lately made her here; and i was convinced of her affection.
if one could but go to brighton!
hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of.
darcy, and lizzy, and kitty, said mrs.
i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley.
long does not keep a carriage, and had to come to the ball in a hack chaise.
it needed all jane s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.
i believe i have now told you everything.
indeed, eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them.
a man who had felt less might.
it was the prospect of constant society, and good society, he added, which was my chief inducement to enter the shire.
his regiment is there; for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.
they descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned.
collins s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair.
and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason.
in a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.
i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs.
it is evident that you belong to the first circles.
very true, my dear, that is exactly what i say.
his family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.
pray forgive me, if i have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p.
darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself.
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, mr.
his pride, said miss lucas, does not offend me so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it.
could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to colonel forster?
but the likeness of quality consists in a great number of common subdivisions of quality demureness, extreme minuteness of touch, avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects.
whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of mr.
he was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied, just as you please.
darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam, i was ignorant of the truth myself.
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.
when this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, mr.
and pray may i ask but checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, is it in address that he improves?
you will not, i hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter s favour, without having paid yourself and mr.
at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him.
if he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, i shall soon cease to regret him at all.
when i am in company with him, i will not be wishing.
a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago.
his character was to speak for itself.
did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?
collins s scruples of leaving mr.
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling.
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting.
my avowed one, or what i avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister was still partial to bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which i have since made.
collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl.
i am only ashamed of his asking so little.
but they did pass away, and mr.
her ladyship s carriage is regularly ordered for us.
if she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough.
bingley, she added; for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned.
i desire you will stay where you are.
his reception, however, was of the most flattering kind.
their brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike man he is a great friend of darcy s.
bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr.
seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman s concurrence.
you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone.
these were the contents: my dear harriet, you will laugh when you know where i am gone, and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as i am missed.
here you are in your own family.
and if i am that choice, why may not i accept him?
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.
you ought all to have learned.
we all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.
she seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to mary at all.
collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family.
if i have wounded your sister s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, i have not yet learnt to condemn them.
but does lydia know nothing of this?
she was confident of having performed her duty; and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.
yet he knew to the contrary himself.
the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly.
but however insincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so.
well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr.
well, then, you need not be under any alarm.
well, lizzy, continued her mother, soon afterwards, and so the collinses live very comfortable, do they?
i rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen.
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply.
gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.
do you play and sing, miss bennet?
and so ended his affection, said elizabeth, impatiently.
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs.
she would be in nobody s way, you know, in that part of the house.
it is more than i engage for, i assure you.
but, if i were you, i would stand by the nephew.
collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to mr.
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.
jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.
i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady.
i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.
how hard it is in some cases to be believed!
i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these.
collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured, with unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.
i have not the pleasure of understanding you, said he, when she had finished her speech.
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.
she could think of nothing but of mr.
and that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and mr.
collins, she added, that lizzy shall be brought to reason.
when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?
her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as mrs.
