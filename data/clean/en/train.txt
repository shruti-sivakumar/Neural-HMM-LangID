this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret.
on reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.
but you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit.
the surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great: but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs.
bingley s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday; and mrs.
she then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card-party, and was sitting upstairs with kitty.
well, mamma, said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast-room, and what do you think of my husband?
to be sure, lizzy, said her aunt, he is not so handsome as wickham; or rather he has not wickham s countenance, for his features are perfectly good.
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country.
the happiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!
miss bingley s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere.
its effect was most extraordinary; for, on first hearing it, mrs.
and now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, make them marry.
darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner.
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all.
her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as mrs.
i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs.
but, my dear sister, can i be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?
she dared not even mention that gentleman.
with all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am i wrong, my dearest jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?
but, my dearest love, tell me what dish mr.
but what is to be done about pemberley?
bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr.
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.
we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us, said mrs.
and that made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable.
de maupassant, and watch him laboriously piling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression.
he should be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.
her mother impatiently met her at the door of her dressing-room, to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself.
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her.
now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.
his marriage was now fast approaching; and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she wished they might be happy.
i am truly glad, dearest lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall i own that i long for your return?
from the further disadvantage of lydia s society she was of course carefully kept; and though mrs.
my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect.
could there be finer symptoms?
collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go.
but i have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.
she attracted him more than he liked; and miss bingley was uncivil to her and more teasing than usual to himself.
i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them.
if it be so, if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable.
his pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by.
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but i was over-ruled, as i always am.
but i have other provocations.
bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son.
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage.
collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy.
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.
bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr.
said he, with a look of doubt.
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.
go, my dear, cried her mother, and show her ladyship about the different walks.
i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady.
bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself.
while mary is adjusting her ideas, he continued, let us return to mr.
bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and, affectionately taking her hand, said, in reply, do not make yourself uneasy, my love.
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr.
but against this there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered.
she saw him start at this; but he said nothing, and she continued, you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it.
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day.
it had better have happened to you, lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.
no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.
elizabeth s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious attention!
my dear father, she cried, come back and write immediately.
your uncle is as much surprised as i am; and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done.
what did you say of me that i did not deserve?
i confess, said he, that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings.
yes; but intricate characters are the most amusing.
on that head, therefore, i shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and jane to make her resigned.
i think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.
no thanks to his gallantry for that.
they now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.
bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.
you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother s permission for this address.
the tumult of elizabeth s mind was allayed by this conversation.
do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will.
did she call to refuse her consent?
gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but elizabeth could not return it.
it is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.
her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.
nobody can tell what i suffer!
the dejection was almost universal.
hill began instantly to express her joy.
daughters are never of so much consequence to a father.
they have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but mrs.
clement s, because wickham s lodgings were in that parish.
bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.
i had narrowly observed her, during the two visits which i had lately made her here; and i was convinced of her affection.
bennet had no turn for economy; and her husband s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.
wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat a salutation which mr.
bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then added, may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr.
we have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine.
bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.
gardiner s behaviour laid them all under.
gracechurch street, my dear niece, i have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you.
why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?
i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.
i know not, miss elizabeth, said he, whether mrs.
only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!
could i expect it to be otherwise?
darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable?
elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile, and said, you mean to frighten me, mr.
he has always something to say to everybody.
its completion depended on others.
bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.
oh, jane, cried elizabeth, was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?
darcy s having both spent three weeks at rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.
you have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
my reasons for believing it are briefly these: it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable.
wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr.
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.
bennet, for anything about the entail.
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness.
forster and me are such friends!) and so she asked the two harringtons to come: but harriet was ill, and so pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?
little more than half a day s journey.
their fortune on both sides is splendid.
collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.
to caroline s assertion of her brother s being partial to miss darcy, she paid no credit.
gardiner s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness.
not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.
she blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk.
lady catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use.
the envelope itself was likewise full.
i have not the pleasure of understanding you, said he, when she had finished her speech.
you are lucky in having such a master.
bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and mr.
ay, no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent; and if i had known your mother, i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one.
collins then returned to elizabeth.
if her world is a microcosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the littleness.
and as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate.
miss bingley did the same; and mrs.
do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?
that is the most unforgiving speech, said elizabeth, that i ever heard you utter.
it cannot be for me, it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened.
darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.
if i could but see you as happy!
that lady, i suppose, is your mother?
do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?
darcy, that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton?
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr.
elizabeth soon heard from her friend, and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been: that it should be equally unreserved was impossible.
they must have seen them together for ever.
that would be a good scheme, said elizabeth, if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home.
he came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them dressed.
i must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.
i am most seriously displeased.
i do not recollect that we did.
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself.
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
such was miss lucas s scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon.
she approached, and saw the likeness of mr.
wickham s chief object was unquestionably my sister s fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement.
but the clothes, the wedding clothes!
they had frequently been staying with her in town.
the park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.
i should be sorry, indeed, if it were.
but there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure.
she had a sister married to a mr.
in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to mrs.
this information made elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor miss bingley.
she has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever.
with all my heart: i will buy pemberley itself, if darcy will sell it.
when colonel miller s regiment went.
bingley s friend, without being heard by either of them.
it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it.
he is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man.
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton!
i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.
on the contrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me?
she was not equal, however, to much conversation; and when miss bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with.
is miss darcy much grown since the spring?
you must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses are merely words of course.
lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.
however, i recollected afterwards, that if he had been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for mr.
certainly, he replied, biting his lips.
and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry?
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.
i hoped to find you reasonable; but depend upon it i will carry my point.
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr.
everything was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself.
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.
she accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost.
but, on second thoughts, perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person.
i am, said he, with a firm voice.
darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.
my father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be.
annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between her and mrs.
how can you be smiling so, lizzy?
he has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter.
that is very true, replied elizabeth, and i could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.
your younger sisters must be very young?
amongst the most violent against him was mrs.
i am not afraid of you, said he, smilingly.
you wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody.
everything being settled between them, mr.
i have been making the tour of the park, he replied, as i generally do every year, and intended to close it with a call at the parsonage.
it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again!
well, jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.
this event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving.
replied kitty, it looks just like that man that used to be with him before.
they all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses.
oh, my dear, cried his wife, i cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
oh, said she, i heard you before; but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply.
it is because he will not give himself the trouble.
bennet, as he folded up the letter.
had colonel forster seen denny himself?
when i am in company with him, i will not be wishing.
how much you must have gone through!
darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them.
for a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.
darcy about it, if you had rather not.
he delighted in going to pemberley, especially when he was least expected.
collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.
those who chose to be idle certainly might.
they were of course all intending to be surprised: but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of mrs.
collins, did i tell you of lady metcalfe s calling yesterday to thank me?
bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.
even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.
i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner.
in a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.
but, lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.
darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.
are any of your younger sisters out, miss bennet?
gardiner, i begin to be of your uncle s opinion.
collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton.
bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and mary went upstairs to her instrument.
elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and, at length, by repeated assurances that mr.
yes, miss bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.
colonel forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody.
he walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind: charlotte tried to console her.
i wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs.
he left netherfield for london on the day following, as you, i am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.
it must be his own doing; he is his own master.
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret.
he likes to have his own way very well, replied colonel fitzwilliam.
from what i can collect, he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them.
she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either.
how shall i bear so much happiness?
darcy, after inquiring of her how mr.
i can much more easily believe mr.
no, indeed, i felt nothing but surprise.
if this be the case, he deserves you.
the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging.
i have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for i am two years older.
i shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on.
gardiner s house, where they were to remain a few days.
if i wished to think slightingly of anybody s children, it should not be of my own, however.
wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither lydia nor mr.
jane s is nothing to it nothing at all.
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents.
i roused and interested you, because i was so unlike them.
was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed?
you shall hear, then but prepare for something very dreadful.
this match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place.
i should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man.
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.
i should say, one of her ladyship s carriages, for she has several.
collins, she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who, she observed to mrs.
i must ask whether you were surprised?
collins, for she vows she will not have him; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her.
but while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.
he is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear miss eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?
our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to you shall try it some day.
what sort of a girl is miss darcy?
it would be such a delicious scheme, and i dare say would hardly cost anything at all.
they are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine.
collins, very gravely but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you.
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted.
indeed he has no improper pride.
darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt s ill-breeding, and made no answer.
is this, thought elizabeth, meant for me?
he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal, regard.
yes; but he seemed to like his second better.
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when mr.
pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?
wickham s happiness and her own was perforce delayed a little longer, and mr.
it was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago.
of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant; but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.
her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies.
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard.
she cried: this is delightful indeed!
in spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to longbourn, desiring her mother to visit jane, and form her own judgment of her situation.
miss lucas is married and settled: and one of my own daughters.
tooks court, chancery lane, london.
elizabeth shook her head over this letter.
i wish i could say anything to comfort you, replied elizabeth; but it is wholly out of my power.
i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again.
painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.
at length the parsonage was discernible.
what advantage can it be to you to offend mr.
that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.
the conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard mr.
the next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour s tête-à-tête with mrs.
my father and maria are to come to me in march, added charlotte, and i hope you will consent to be of the party.
they were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.
thank you, said lydia; for if you did, i should certainly tell you all, and then wickham would be so angry.
miss darcy, the daughter of mr.
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer.
gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.
long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided.
whenever charlotte came to see them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr.
and that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and mr.
it was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of miss bennet s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.
it is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions.
but if i do not take your likeness now, i may never have another opportunity.
she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.
never since reading jane s second letter had she entertained a hope of wickham s meaning to marry her.
and this is always the way with him, she added.
collins as the wisest thing she ever did.
to me this humour seems to possess a greater affinity, on the whole, to that of addison than to any other of the numerous species of this great british genus.
he could be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?
darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london!
bennet, you will wait on him, of course.
but jane was to go home with her, and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.
she knew not what to think, or how to account for it.
it was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.
i have no such injuries to resent.
as soon as they entered, bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, mrs.
elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last kitty did, she very innocently said, what is the matter, mamma?
an unhappy alternative is before you, elizabeth.
when she thought of her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr.
we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice.
but i will not be alarmed, though your sister does play so well.
the rector of a parish has much to do.
bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly.
that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on, i shall not attempt to deny.
she was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister s spirits.
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and mrs.
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.
gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again.
i am sure i shan t get a wink of sleep all night.
i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home, and see if i can make it up any better.
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them, and sign my name lydia wickham.
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her sense of shame was severe.
so high and so conceited, that there was no enduring him!
he heard her with astonishment.
you will not be fit to be seen when you get there.
bennet, as she entered the room, we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.
eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley, and then hurried away to dress.
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited.
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.
collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to mr.
my affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.
dawson oh, your father, of course, may spare you, if your mother can.
bingley and jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them.
bennet could not have chosen better.
she has one only daughter, the heiress of rosings, and of very extensive property.
howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs.
but there are two things that i want very much to know: one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how i am ever to pay him.
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park.
you will be a very happy woman.
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr.
darcy had much better finish his letter.
bennet: she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it, and could not help saying so.
my dear, said maria, quite shocked at the mistake, it is not lady catherine.
had he done his duty in that respect, lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her.
collins by jane s introduction of him.
miss bennet, do you know who i am?
i have met with two instances lately: one i will not mention, the other is charlotte s marriage.
kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room.
human nature is so prone to fall into it!
collins to join his daughters in their walk; and mr.
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage, and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out.
but i confess they would have no charms for me.
can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?
collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with mr.
elizabeth jumped out; and after giving each of them a hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where jane, who came running downstairs from her mother s apartment, immediately met her.
she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent, but had not courage for it.
bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.
the possibility of meeting mr.
on the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks.
accompanied by their aunt what can be the meaning of this?
they owed the restoration of lydia, her character, everything to him.
reynolds was of no trifling nature.
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much; and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.
he called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself.
darcy, and lizzy, and kitty, said mrs.
it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh s family.
i did not think you would; and that being the case, i cannot consider your situation with much compassion.
his character sunk on every review of it; and, as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr.
it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.
my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you can t think.
so imprudent a match on both sides!
elizabeth did not know what to make of it.
my dearest child, she cried, i can think of nothing else.
colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object.
wickham had resolved on quitting the militia.
to walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!
no, said colonel fitzwilliam, that is an advantage which he must divide with me.
the looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.
your attendance upon her has been too much for you.
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.
generous, good man, i am afraid he has distressed himself.
you were not by, when i told mamma, and the others, all about it.
reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.
darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.
she may even have been one in the further sense that, like her own mr.
she dreaded seeing wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.
darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach.
no, really, replied elizabeth; i think there cannot be too little said on the subject.
if i were not afraid of judging harshly, i should be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this.
she assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her.
are you much acquainted with mr.
his consenting to marry her is a proof, i will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking.
you have said quite enough, madam.
they followed her into the dining-parlour.
when first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.
she studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different.
jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out, oh, papa, what news?
and then we were so merry all the way home!
i will speak to her about it myself directly.
but he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not.
my real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if i could, whether i might ever hope to make you love me.
yes, replied wickham; his estate there is a noble one.
there is, perhaps, a very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to me very faint indeed.
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship s entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping lucases.
oh, single, my dear, to be sure!
it is nothing in comparison of rosings, my lady, i dare say; but, i assure you, it is much larger than sir william lucas s.
that is exactly what i should have supposed of you, said elizabeth.
my beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.
nor was darcy s vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.
and they are really to be married!
i cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished.
collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte.
everybody is disgusted with his pride.
darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in maria s astonishment at her being so thin and so small.
that he was surprised by the connection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and, so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with mr.
they could talk of nothing but officers; and mr.
and pray what sort of a guardian do you make?
gardiner, wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers.
perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh, said elizabeth.
they lagged behind, while elizabeth, kitty, and darcy were to entertain each other.
there is, i believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here.
gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.
take almost any frenchman, except the late m.
collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured, with unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.
they are all for what they can get.
hurst or miss bingley; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord, how tired i am!
here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.
after a short pause, her companion added, you are too generous to trifle with me.
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr.
bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all.
it is a nice long walk, and mr.
something very much to the purpose, of course.
and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?
bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable.
there can be no doubt of that.
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs.
no, lizzy, that is what i do not choose.
it has been most unconsciously done, however, and i hope will be of short duration.
it was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.
an express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from colonel forster, to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with wickham!
in society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great.
as no objection was made to the young people s engagement with their aunt, and all mr.
wickham, lydia, were all forgotten.
you can now have nothing further to say, she resentfully answered.
if there were but such another man for you!
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt s arrival.
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out.
gardiner, looking at the picture; it is a handsome face.
laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.
if he wants our society, let him seek it.
i am prodigiously proud of him.
hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.
i had much rather go in the coach.
and who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them?
his affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend.
wickham walked into the room, elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.
you are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.
bennet, that is exactly what i could most wish for.
elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.
when i last saw her, she was not very promising.
she wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject.
they saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.
now, be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it.
have you never happened to see her there?
have a little compassion on my nerves.
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr.
she looked at jane, and smiled, and shook her head, by turns.
remember, eliza, that he does not know jane s disposition as you do.
a great deal more passed at the other table.
she then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two.
bennet, and the mortification of kitty, are scarcely to be described.
bingley is coming down, sister, (for mrs.
oh, certainly, said elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; we will ask you no questions.
but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take pemberley for a kind of model.
norris, and one or two others to their company, but who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still superior to them.
elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation.
they repulsed every attempt of mrs.
and pray, lizzy, what said lady catherine about this report?
bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, as ever i saw.
you may well warn me against such an evil.
follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, do divert me, i own, and i laugh at them whenever i can.
she is my youngest girl but one.
what an excellent father you have, girls, said she, when the door was shut.
she then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley.
it is evident that you belong to the first circles.
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one.
philips s manners and politeness.
collins made his declaration in form.
you must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention; your feelings, i know, will bestow it unwillingly, but i demand it of your justice.
till i was in kent, and saw so much both of mr.
i will think no more about him.
very true, indeed; and now, my dear jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?
i wish i might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through, i am afraid, is pitiful.
his apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.
bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.
collins and charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party.
at length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction.
as it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.
cried elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.
bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.
and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs.
that is not very likely; our authority was too good.
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.
if you are a good girl for the next ten years, i will take you to a review at the end of them.
darcy s letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend.
he is now gone into the army, she added; but i am afraid he has turned out very wild.
as soon as i get to town, i shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to gracechurch street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done.
at our time of life, it is not so pleasant, i can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes we would do anything.
it is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which i am now complaining.
but i can assure you, she added, that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing.
whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.
do not imagine me ignorant of their condition.
i was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.
if it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.
collins s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs.
gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at longbourn.
he was her dear wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.
the party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.
by supposing such an affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy.
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.
her heart did whisper that he had done it for her.
reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, is my master and very like him.
bennet and kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone, mr.
i am sorry, exceedingly sorry, replied darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.
and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of such moment as this, i shall certainly not depart from it.
no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection; miss bingley, i am sure, cannot: she is not such a simpleton.
i sometimes wish that the exigencies of the story had permitted miss austen to unite these personages, and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe poor mrs.
collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater.
gardiner s hope of lydia s being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance.
they have a sharp, shrewish look, which i do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable.
walked back with them copyright 1894 by george allen.
i cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation.
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.
while sir william was with them, mr.
only let me assure you, my dear miss elizabeth, that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.
after an affectionate parting between the friends, elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr.
if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside, cried bingley, it would not make them one jot less agreeable.
by elizabeth s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.
but i wonder how long you would have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.
tis an etiquette i despise, said he.
what would i give to hear your strictures on them!
i saw them the night before last.
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me.
my mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know, how much i suffer from what she says.
bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it.
take whatever you like, and get away.
he is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming, said her uncle.
the evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of jane and elizabeth.
you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him.
bingley, said elizabeth, must disarm reproof.
how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter!
gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks: mrs.
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her entreaty that she would not give in to it.
can he be a sensible man, sir?
but his anger, i am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments.
darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right.
i cannot think of it without abhorrence.
collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting.
are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?
charles, when you build your house, i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley.
darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to mrs.
you cannot be more than twenty, i am sure, therefore you need not conceal your age.
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them, for mr.
f.; but no one can throw any blame on them.
he meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it.
and with these words he hastily left the room, and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him.
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn.
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.
i will not encourage the imprudence of either, by receiving them at longbourn.
i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which i am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.
collins first came to hunsford.
he was to come there with wickham, you know.
on sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place.
a little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs.
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia; and, removed from the influence of lydia s example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid.
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken.
i am excessively attentive to all those things.
he brought it with him for us to see.
unless the elder brother is very sickly, i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.
let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to mr.
nay, were your friend lady catherine to know me, i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.
i had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company.
she is grown so brown and coarse!
i told you in the library, you know, that i should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word.
you must learn some of my philosophy.
they then sat down, and when her inquiries after rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.
my youngest of all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man, who, i believe, will soon become a part of the family.
with a book, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations.
shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill-qualified to recommend himself to strangers?
she will be down in a moment, i dare say.
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone.
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but, if the same circumstances were to happen again, i am sure i should be deceived again.
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.
darcy s sister, as, by wickham s account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.
if he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, i shall soon cease to regret him at all.
darcy, she could not but allow that mr.
thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.
i came to you without a doubt of my reception.
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more, i think, than last year.
darcy, observed miss bingley, in a half whisper, that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.
you used us abominably ill, answered mrs.
my dear father, i congratulate you.
what congratulations will then flow in!
bingley s attention to her sister, elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.
on this subject i have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer.
never intended to go there, or to marry lydia at all, which was repeated to colonel f., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from b., intending to trace their route.
oh yes i understand you perfectly.
cried elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.
what could your ladyship propose by it?
this unfortunate affair will, i fear, prevent my sister s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to-day.
you know my mother s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends.
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern.
gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham s desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.
when the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to elizabeth, do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.
she will drop the acquaintance entirely.
his pride, said miss lucas, does not offend me so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it.
i was uncomfortable enough, i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy.
elizabeth could not but look surprised.
she says lizzy had better have taken mr.
you know pretty well, i suppose, what has been done for the young people.
has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?
each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr.
but, if i were you, i would stand by the nephew.
had i been in love, i could not have been more wretchedly blind.
i will put on my things in a moment.
in lydia s imagination, a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness.
well, that was very decided, indeed that does seem as if but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.
miss bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth.
i cannot blame myself for having done thus much.
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr.
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should meet.
he had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it.
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton.
bingley s chaise to go to meryton; and the hursts have no horses to theirs.
when they get to our age, i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.
elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.
wickham had accepted their uncle s invitation, and was then in the house.
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect.
collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as i have often told her, to come to rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in mrs.
nothing could console and nothing appease her.
if i had known as much this morning, i certainly would not have called on him.
your portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.
she replied in the affirmative.
but she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.
from their infancy, they have been intended for each other.
darcy s using him ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though george wickham has treated mr.
it needed all jane s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.
it was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.
wickham s intention to go into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.
his sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards mr.
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.
i did not know that you intended to walk, said miss bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.
elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile.
you know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, i confess, before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice.
i was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.
collins, she added, that lizzy shall be brought to reason.
his letter was soon despatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution.
his revenge would have been complete indeed.
since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with wickham, he easily learnt had never been his design.
kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.
louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again.
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?
it is enough to know they are discovered: i have seen them both but perhaps you would like to read it then it is as i always hoped, cried jane: they are married!
they were not the only objects of mr.
he is so excessively handsome!
wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball.
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.
caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that i can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself.
the moment of her release from him was ecstasy.
and what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?
the business was therefore soon settled.
yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor.
bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day?
a young man, such as you describe mr.
i have more than once observed to lady catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her.
his choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.
bennet was stirring the fire (and we know how mrs.
she has two nieces of her own.
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter.
i might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, i am thus rejected.
how odious i should think them!
ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it.
i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation, replied elizabeth; but it is not in my power to accept it.
bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family.
bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though mrs.
i never saw such a long chin in my life.
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge, and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.
lady catherine, sir william, and mr.
i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain.
whatever can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.
he had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein.
bingley from your sister, and the other, that i had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr.
bennet s ill humour or ill health.
is there nothing you could take to give you present relief?
but people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.
i know you will do him such ample justice, that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.
but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities, replied her uncle.
wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character.
you know nothing of the matter.
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.
if we make haste, said lydia, as they walked along, perhaps we may see something of captain carter, before he goes.
he had been some time with mr.
not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did mrs.
my avowed one, or what i avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister was still partial to bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which i have since made.
i think she did take this delight, and i do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while she was immensely the better for it as an artist.
promise me, therefore, to come to hunsford.
bennet could hardly contain herself.
not a soul knew of it, but colonel and mrs.
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.
elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.
and this is your real opinion!
you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.
i see your design, bingley, said his friend.
said charlotte, as soon as he was gone.
whenever she spoke in a low voice mrs.
bingley, it is very hard to have her taken away from me.
darcy, i am sure, said miss bingley; and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition.
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of mr.
collins is really great; far greater than anything addison ever did, almost great enough for fielding or for swift himself.
since the shire were first quartered in meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers, have been in her head.
collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine s being rather displeased by her staying at home.
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable.
after abusing you so abominably to your face, i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations.
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention.
here, consequently, was an inexhaustible subject of discourse.
they talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of everything but himself; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs.
mary and kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, i am sure, but i did not think it right for either of them.
if it was to be a secret, said jane, say not another word on the subject.
collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st.
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you.
in spite of having been at st.
we will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.
you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr.
wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly, lydia once.
no i cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else.
he merely added, that he should not write again, till he had something of importance to mention.
the evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary.
i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least.
darcy might have done as well.
i know little of the game at present, said he, but i shall be glad to improve myself; for in my situation of life mrs.
so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph.
they will have nothing else to do.
we have not met since the 26th of november, when we were all dancing together at netherfield.
on the other hand, i, for my part, declare for pride and prejudice unhesitatingly.
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance.
one morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to elizabeth, lizzy, i never gave you an account of my wedding, i believe.
bennet s best comfort was, that mr.
miss bingley, said he, has given me credit for more than can be.
elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, mrs.
your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; i do not know what to say to you.
then taking the disengaged arm of mr.
oh, why is not everybody as happy?
a lively imagination soon settled it all.
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameless distrust.
and prejudice by jane austen, with a preface by george saintsbury and illustrations by hugh thomson ruskin cross road.
you have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.
as a child i was taught what was right, but i was not taught to correct my temper.
she longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence mrs.
wickham s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife s.
she read over her aunt s commendation of him again and again.
the one was humanity, and the other was art.
colonel forster came yesterday, having left brighton the day before, not many hours after the express.
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.
gardiner, i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor wickham.
but now it was all too natural.
jones says we must not think of moving her.
after a short silence the lady first spoke.
bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer.
that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask.
not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the pemberley house, is a powerful motive.
there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.
i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.
bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily, you are very kind, sir, i am sure; and i wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.
i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear.
darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than i could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself.
vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled!
tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?
a short pause followed this speech, and mrs.
he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.
when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner s in town so much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.
and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books.
i am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose mr.
on the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband.
both changed colour, one looked white, the other red.
well, well, said he, do not make yourself unhappy.
i have sent for you on an affair of importance.
your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.
two obstacles of the five being thus removed, mrs.
miss bennet still looked all amazement.
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt.
colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on lydia s side, but nothing to give him any alarm.
collins arrived on tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelve-month s abode in the family might have prompted.
i am thinking of what you have been telling me, said she.
yes, there was something in that; i told you so from the first, you may remember.
darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.
as she pronounced these words, mr.
is that his design in settling here?
wickham passed all his youth there, you know.
in marrying your nephew, i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere.
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all.
and we mean to treat you all, added lydia; but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.
these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature.
the boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would; and the argument ended only with the visit.
my sole dependence was on you; and i am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine.
when convinced on that article, miss bennet had nothing further to wish.
i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object.
i should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire.
how wonderfully these sort of things occur!
why must their marriage be private?
during their walk, it was resolved that mr.
pray go to see them, with sir william and maria.
lady catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts.
his wife was evidently, and must always have been, a quite irreclaimable fool; and unless he had shot her or himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but the ironic.
darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.
bennet, she took an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at work her fools and her mean persons.
perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr.
well, and what news does it bring good or bad?
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts?
he meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.
but i will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning.
she was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when.
she is almost three-and-twenty!
darcy half so well as i do my dear wickham, you must be very happy.
i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children.
it taught me to hope, said he, as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before.
there are few people in england, i suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste.
when is your next ball to be, lizzy?
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.
darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise.
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to netherfield.
darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.
do not you want to know who has taken it?
her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to elizabeth s wishes, for she was impatient to get home.
to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add.
a military life is not what i was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible.
how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!
had he been a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, he might have been still smarting under his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had come husband-hunting.
jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.
but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head.
collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it.
they were interrupted by miss bennet, who came to fetch her mother s tea.
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least.
james s had made him courteous.
collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received.
an union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations.
i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party.
the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late mr.
she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
they have none of them much to recommend them, replied he: they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.
collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn.
bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband s not being killed in a duel.
i am only ashamed of his asking so little.
i knew it myself, as it was known to miss bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it.
she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable.
i have told miss bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though mrs.
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, lizzy?
well, i was so frightened i did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day.
no; it would have been strange if they had.
long said so too, for i asked her whether you did not.
darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning.
after a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.
she is a great deal too ill to be moved.
and so, my dear sister, i find, from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen pemberley.
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.
gardiner, and miss bennet, to dinner at pemberley, before they left the country.
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.
but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem.
i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley.
if i have wounded your sister s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, i have not yet learnt to condemn them.
i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.
i never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united.
he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away; and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.
i thank you for my share of the favour, said elizabeth; but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.
he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship, replied elizabeth, with emphasis, and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life.
bennet withdrew to the library, she saw mr.
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?
my faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!
a few days after this visit, mr.
reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his father s lifetime.
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton, and see how everybody went on; but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings, and had sent for him only the saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening.
at present, however, i consider myself as quite fixed here.
everybody said how well she looked; and mr.
hurst, by whom elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs.
to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of mr.
he studies too much for words of four syllables.
do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh?
bingley was everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.
bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on miss lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of her family.
when darcy returned to the saloon, miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.
among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds?
she is upstairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all.
kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.
i declare i do not know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a sunday evening, when he has nothing to do.
miss bennet s pleasing manners grew on the good-will of mrs.
oh, my dear brother, replied mrs.
do you think it incredible that mr.
forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to brighton.
my dear madam, replied he, let us be for ever silent on this point.
darcy was fixed in astonishment.
and his answering immediately to the last question, oh, the eldest miss bennet, beyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.
there was no want of discourse.
she could have added, a young man, too, like you, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable.
you see how continually we are engaged there.
last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.
the carriage was sent to meet them at , and they were to return in it by dinnertime.
they had often attempted it before: but it was a subject on which mrs.
he repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.
i would not be so fastidious as you are, cried bingley, for a kingdom!
it would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.
to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!
bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice.
for though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof.
certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.
send back your answer as soon as you can, and be careful to write explicitly.
very few days passed in which mr.
i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse.
bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr.
bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.
darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but in vain.
darcy s eyes were fixed on her.
darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.
very well and this offer of marriage you have refused?
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion.
collins was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied, it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably.
they are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.
but your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.
colonel fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman.
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.
do you certainly leave kent on saturday?
how could his will be disregarded?
once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general charlotte wisely did not hear.
and so, darcy did everything; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow s debts, and got him his commission!
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of mr.
bennet and of lady catherine de bourgh.
i am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.
the housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master s steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expense.
but of course she did not mention my name to you.
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.
kitty has no discretion in her coughs, said her father; she times them ill.
in understanding, darcy was the superior.
at least, therefore, i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.
my father has gone to london, and jane has written to beg my uncle s immediate assistance, and we shall be off, i hope, in half an hour.
bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable.
i leave it to yourself to determine, said mr.
he was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex.
bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield.
why must she be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold?
he is the best landlord, and the best master, said she, that ever lived.
and yet how many things have happened!
jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh s being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light.
hurst and miss bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in london.
i wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.
but, however, he is very welcome to come to netherfield, if he likes it.
did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?
the one mis-sent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago.
let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor; and his inquiry to his colossal cousin as to the compliments which mr.
instead of viewing them as a stranger, i might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.
my visit was not long, as caroline and mrs.
hurst thought the same, and added, she has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker.
i have heard much of your master s fine person, said mrs.
i fancy, lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all.
for the liveliness of your mind i did.
you must not disappoint your father.
it was greatly my wish that he should do so, he added, as soon as his marriage was fixed on.
elizabeth now began to revive.
then, after a short silence, he continued, lizzy, i bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last may, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.
if your master would marry, you might see more of him.
miss bennet, i insist on being satisfied.
darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only.
i must not decide on my own performance.
seriously, i would have you be on your guard.
what is it you are talking of?
she saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.
yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near cheapside.
perhaps, said darcy, i should have judged better had i sought an introduction, but i am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.
they are gone down to newcastle, a place quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, i do not know how long.
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.
the particulars i reserve till we meet.
to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.
but how did he account for it?
bennet was really in a most pitiable state.
no, said darcy, i have made no such pretension.
they met again on sunday, and then i saw him too.
yes, very indifferent, indeed, said elizabeth, laughingly.
with the mention of derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.
gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south.
pride, observed mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, is a very common failing, i believe.
bingley s being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.
darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.
what are men to rocks and mountains?
when the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her, in return, by sitting down to whist.
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection.
pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of, cried colonel fitzwilliam.
but what does he say of the living?
the fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention.
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman.
darcy s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home.
you dislike an argument, and want to silence this.
if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield, said mrs.
collins s offer was now nearly at an end, and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.
she tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done.
then you would drink a great deal more than you ought, said mrs.
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character.
i can hardly write for laughing.
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.
not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter and said, jane, i congratulate you.
this is an evening of wonders, indeed!
all young ladies accomplished!
in such an exigence my uncle s advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what i must feel, and i rely upon his goodness.
my dear jane, i am in such a flutter, that i am sure i can t write; so i will dictate, and you write for me.
a great deal of good management, depend upon it.
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said, i was surprised to see darcy in town last month.
bingley s carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.
darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.
wickham; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday, saturday, sunday, and monday endurable to kitty and lydia.
elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother s thoughts, now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away.
certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them.
she expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther.
the consequence of it is, that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have, and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever.
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.
you are over scrupulous, surely.
and a special licence you must and shall be married by a special licence.
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster s!
but that is one great difference between us.
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother s being an inmate of mr.
perhaps there was some truth in this; though i doubt whether his reserve, or anybody s reserve can be answerable for the event.
elizabeth went away with her head full of him.
i was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.
i never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses.
hill, in great astonishment, don t you know there is an express come for master from mr.
be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy.
gardiner had seen pemberley, and known the late mr.
nichols was in meryton last night: i saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certainly true.
elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them.
i think you said she was a widow, sir?
cried lydia: i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that.
if i should ever go to brighton, i would behave better than lydia.
i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner: i wish i could see her.
with mary, miss austen has taken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her; not merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interesting traditional appendices which mr.
smiles decked the face of mrs.
you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.
bennet s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman s punctuality, both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs.
that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain; but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.
this he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed.
persuasion, relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling in interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite delicacy and keeping.
collins s scruples of leaving mr.
you may as well call it impertinence at once.
charlotte did not stay much longer; and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.
perhaps other people have said so before, but no one with such justice.
i am sure, said she, i cried for two days together when colonel miller s regiment went away.
he had never had the slightest suspicion.
but that is not the case here.
oh, thoughtless, thoughtless lydia!
darcy could have such boundless influence.
one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly of himself.
let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.
bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was.
but it is not merely this affair, she continued, on which my dislike is founded.
but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name.
i will not trust myself on the subject, replied wickham; i can hardly be just to him.
upon my honour, i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening; and there are several of them, you see, uncommonly pretty.
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing.
she was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying, is your sister at pemberley still?
far be it from me, he presently continued, in a voice that marked his displeasure, to resent the behaviour of your daughter.
bingley s sincerity, said elizabeth warmly, but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.
nothing is more deceitful, said darcy, than the appearance of humility.
at length darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, mr.
who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him?
bennet, we shall have her at netherfield at last!
she will be taken good care of.
you may well be surprised, miss bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday.
whatever i do is done in a hurry, replied he; and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield, i should probably be off in five minutes.
the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten.
he is certainly a good brother, said elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.
no, that i am sure i shall not: and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.
i am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings.
yes, i have had a letter from him by express.
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves, i can hardly tell, but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you.
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said, you are mistaken, mr.
there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us.
there is one point on which i want your advice.
merely to the illustration of your character, said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity.
we may compare our different opinions.
darcy smiled and said, you are perfectly right.
bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered by her communication.
lizzy, when you first read that letter, i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now.
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.
darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that mr.
i cannot find out that i hate her at all, or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl.
elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs together.
some people call him proud; but i am sure i never saw anything of it.
how it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd!
she was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence; mr.
yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.
bennet s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.
nobody wants him to come; though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and, if i was her, i would not have put up with it.
my good opinion once lost is lost for ever.
bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.
they are wanted in the farm, mr.
perhaps i am not doing her justice.
gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.
elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.
he could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr.
this is wholly unexpected; i had not an idea of it.
it was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.
their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.
i have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.
darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.
pray tell your sister that i long to see her.
and who knows what may happen?
when she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.
oh, yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!
if we are ever able to learn what wickham s debts have been, said elizabeth, and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what mr.
as they went down stairs together, charlotte said, i shall depend on hearing from you very often, eliza.
besides, there was truth in his looks.
her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.
and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself?
long does not keep a carriage, and had to come to the ball in a hack chaise.
yes, there can; for mine is totally different.
i almost envy you the pleasure, and yet i believe it would be too much for me, or else i could take it in my way to newcastle.
collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr.
and what am i to do on the occasion?
my dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying, and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before.
her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved.
nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.
this swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears nowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable mr.
i do assure you, sir, that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.
charlotte herself was tolerably composed.
nothing could be more delightful!
it is as often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour s acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.
ay, because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield, and he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to.
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.
he immediately offered to fetch her others; all that his library afforded.
i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point.
till this moment, i never knew myself.
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion.
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever.
at five o clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner.
i do, i do like him, she replied, with tears in her eyes; i love him.
it was lady catherine de bourgh.
she then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham.
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.
can you deny that you have done it?
elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from pemberley.
elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.
you must, therefore, allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform what i look on as a point of duty.
he was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey.
with a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.
i know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either.
bingley did not do justice to his own disposition.
the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt.
as soon as they were gone, elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects which must deaden them more.
we were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.
bennet very dull for several days.
if his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom.
your mother insists upon your accepting it.
a resemblance in good-humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other, and out of their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two.
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.
my father, however, is partial to mr.
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance; and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer.
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr.
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.
many stared many smiled; but no one looked more amused than mr.
she was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.
you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone.
in the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger.
you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, mr.
jane will be quite an old maid soon, i declare.
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane.
we must not make him desperate.
collins has made you an offer of marriage.
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again.
are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?
bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon.
i do not wish to avoid the walk.
a clear ten thousand per annum.
he spoke of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security.
you must come and make lizzy marry mr.
how ashamed i should be of not being married before three-and-twenty!
she wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.
i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.
there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, i begin to think it perfectly reasonable.
at present i will not say more, but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted he was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other.
i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for anything more.
for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter.
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth; but at last, on mrs.
have you any idea, lizzy, who this gentleman is?
elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation.
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as elizabeth half expected mr.
do you suppose them to be in london?
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.
she opened the door, and met maria in the landing-place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out, in conversation with the ladies oh, my dear eliza!
bennet said only, nonsense, nonsense!
you know him too well to doubt the rest.
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and, in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.
he made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him.
his being neither is exactly consistent with the probable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not really injured in disposition, and thoroughly in love.
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.
i was sometimes quite provoked; but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.
i am afraid you do not like your pen.
bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, i am sure.
but here he was set right by mrs.
a small sum could not do all this.
i am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word; and elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on.
elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph.
bingley, if he had been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.
my mind was more agreeably engaged.
yes, or i will never see her again.
she will be married at sixteen!
bennet, one day, what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane s?
lady catherine then observed, your father s estate is entailed on mr.
she dared not relate the other half of mr.
a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation.
so far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference was great.
it is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill.
philips first brought her the news).
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw.
while i can have my mornings to myself, said she, it is enough.
i ought not to have said a word about it.
it amazes me, i confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction.
bennet, said his lady to him one day, have you heard that netherfield park is let at last?
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family.
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr.
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday, to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which i particularly begged him to do.
and do you really love him quite well enough?
well, girls, said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, what say you to the day?
lydia was exceedingly fond of him.
philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence.
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.
at last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of matlock and dovedale with great perseverance.
well, colonel fitzwilliam, what do i play next?
these recollections will not do at all.
i shall like it of all things.
read it aloud, said their father, for i hardly know myself what it is about.
this roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.
i shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.
a clergyman like you must marry.
oh, it must be my uncle s doings!
who are your uncles and aunts?
will you do me the honour of reading that letter?
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully.
it was the prospect of constant society, and good society, he added, which was my chief inducement to enter the shire.
my dear brother, at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, i hope will give you satisfaction.
philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could.
jane had already written a few lines to her sister, to announce their safe arrival in london; and when she wrote again, elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys.
it was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.
elizabeth again, and more seriously, assured her of its truth.
it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire.
lizzy, said he, i was going to look for you: come into my room.
my mother is tolerably well, i trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken.
she looked at jane to see how she bore it; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley.
but we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation.
wickham and our poor lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland.
the comfort to her, of the regiment s approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression.
bennet could not give her consent, or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when mr.
darcy has not authorized me to make his communication public.
darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.
i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me.
for god s sake, say no more of his partners.
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.
but it must not, shall not be!
on this subject, what can you have to say?
she does not disguise from herself or anybody that she resents darcy s first ill-mannered personality with as personal a feeling.
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucases last week; and even mr.
collins attending them to point out its beauties, and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.
bennet s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read, well, jane, who is it from?
at such a distance as that, you know, things are strangely misrepresented.
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.
if he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till sir william was out of sight.
mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.
the two first dances, however, brought a return of distress: they were dances of mortification.
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming.
elizabeth, to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation.
jane looked at her doubtingly.
and what sort of table do they keep?
i suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers.
gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.
bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her courtesy and address of his friend.
i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you.
conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none.
what think you of this sentence, my dear lizzy?
you never see a fault in anybody.
it certainly is a most iniquitous affair, said mr.
elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that mr.
yes; she will remain there till christmas.
that you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had not turned out well.
his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham.
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr.
her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank.
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair.
i have not been used to submit to any person s whims.
for my part, i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody.
lizzy, said her father, i have given him my consent.
collins s side, and as many bows on sir william s, they departed.
he begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her.
her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world!
he was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it.
but the gloom of lydia s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from mrs.
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister s infamous elopement.
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening.
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.
you want to tell me, and i have no objection to hearing it.
i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought, nor their offences against myself.
take care, lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.
it was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.
darcy s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: mr.
if she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough.
darcy might leave the country, but that he should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week.
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though i am sure (and i do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.
you doubt me, cried jane, slightly colouring; indeed, you have no reason.
when i wrote that letter, replied darcy, i believed myself perfectly calm and cool; but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.
come as soon as you can on the receipt of this.
though not in the least impudent and mannish grown, she has no mere sensibility, no nasty niceness about her.
did he know of their intending to go off?
what a delightful library you have at pemberley, mr.
if she heard me, it was by good luck, for i am sure she did not listen.
at such a time much might have been said, and silence was very awkward.
elizabeth s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted mr.
but not before they went to brighton?
as for your elizabeth s picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?
but i suppose you had no opportunity.
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia, assisted by kitty s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn.
in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?
they soon outstripped the others; and when they had reached the carriage, mr.
bingley s being imposed on than that mr.
anything beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn, i suppose, would appear far.
i am glad he dines here on tuesday.
bingley will dance with you at the next ball.
if you will thank me, he replied, let it be for yourself alone.
bingley s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him.
i never heard any harm of her; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.
if she does not object to it, why should we?
how could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?
i know you do: and it is that which makes the wonder.
it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year.
darcy walked off; and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.
in essentials, i believe, he is very much what he ever was.
she stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent.
they were, in fact, very fine ladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.
and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma am?
when those dances were over, she returned to charlotte lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr.
they met several times, for there was much to be discussed.
lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her.
i thank you for explaining it so fully.
i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.
lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation.
he did everything best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september than anybody else in the country.
have all her friends left her?
i cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as i often see done.
collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many.
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.
many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter: i wish i could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that i despair.
with your good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others!
you make me laugh, charlotte; but it is not sound.
it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should.
you are too hasty, sir, she cried.
as her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence.
i am exceedingly gratified, said bingley, by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.
he took the hint, and, when mary had finished her second song, said aloud, that will do extremely well, child.
when coffee was over, colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a quarter of an hour.
bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle.
it has been coming on so gradually, that i hardly know when it began; but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley.
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world.
i am more likely to want time than courage, elizabeth.
if your feelings are still what they were last april, tell me so at once.
i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require.
then addressing her daughter, oh, my dear, dear jane, i am so happy!
in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.
elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known sir william s too long.
it is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.
let me never see either one or the other again!
yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent.
that is very true, said elizabeth; though it had not occurred to me before.
this was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas.
collins she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
i am going to gretna green, and if you cannot guess with who, i shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world i love, and he is an angel.
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from mrs.
this information, however, startled mrs.
i expected you to stay two months.
he has not an ill-natured look.
but you forget, mamma, said elizabeth, that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that mrs.
o that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!
she is happy, then, said her father, drily; and her residence there will probably be of some duration.
in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, i take no leave of you, miss bennet.
he was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.
come here, child, cried her father as she appeared.
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire.
collins sat down to quadrille; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs.
then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce mr.
poor reynolds, she was always very fond of me.
elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.
forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by-the-bye, mrs.
not at all, he replied: they were brightened by the exercise.
darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred.
i do not blame jane, she continued, for jane would have got mr.
this accounted to elizabeth for mr.
they were off saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight.
you are then resolved to have him?
philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.
lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age.
he has the promise of an ensigncy in general s regiment, now quartered in the north.
we shall be at newcastle all the winter, and i dare say there will be some balls, and i will take care to get good partners for them all.
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister s ready acquiescence.
how is half such a sum to be repaid?
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive to jane s happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring.
also there is in both a certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty.
put them next to your great-uncle the judge.
collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know he is, as well as i do; and you must feel, as well as i do, that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking.
as they passed through the hall, lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent-looking rooms, walked on.
where there is fortune to make the expense of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.
bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham s removal from the shire, as clearly as mr.
she was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother s manners there was something better than politeness there was good-humour and kindness.
gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party.
he is the kind of man, indeed, to whom i should never dare refuse anything, which he condescended to ask.
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time, but mr.
lady catherine rose also, and they turned back.
you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.
change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything.
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas, for mr.
but, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, i am sure.
well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.
i am sure i know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.
she was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper.
at that moment she cared for no other.
let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor.
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning; and mr.
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr.
bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.
his being so sure of succeeding was wrong, said she, and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment.
everything wore a happier aspect.
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great.
my dear lizzy, where can you have been walking to?
while she spoke, wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning.
the good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood.
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour.
darcy can please where he chooses.
darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage.
after playing some italian songs, miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air; and soon afterwards mr.
soon after you left me on saturday, i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were.
she smiled, but made no answer.
bennet; and nothing can clear mr.
to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting.
we must not all expect jane s good fortune.
having said thus much, i feel no doubt of your secrecy.
but to live with and to marry, i do not know that any one of the four can come into competition with elizabeth.
the whole party have left netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.
but what, said she, after a pause, can have been his motive?
my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better.
the business of her life was to get her daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.
my dearest sister, now be, be serious.
our situation with regard to lady catherine s family is, indeed, the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.
bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.
excuse me, for i must speak plainly.
though her manner varied, however, her determination never did.
the pause was to elizabeth s feelings dreadful.
bingley called again, and alone.
collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others.
his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine made everything easy.
a younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.
yet he knew to the contrary himself.
i am sure there is not on his.
darcy approaching them, and at no great distance.
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.
he made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty.
if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room, i shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.
pray do not talk of that odious man.

may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?
darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.
lady catherine de bourgh, she replied, has very lately given him a living.
darcy mean, said she to charlotte, by listening to my conversation with colonel forster?
collins, was a most humiliating picture!
be assured, my dear sir, that mrs.
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.
i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park.
bingley, i always keep servants that can do their own work; my daughters are brought up differently.
she will make him a very proper wife.
away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection.
a single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year.
when this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, mr.
some time hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to elizabeth s salutation than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage: he shook his head when i expressed my hopes, and said he feared w.
lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention.
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that mr.
do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley.
wickham immediately to elizabeth s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented.
yes; where else can they be so well concealed?
collins, or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife, the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge.
i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.
but you know married women have never much time for writing.
it was at sir william lucas s, where a large party were assembled.
perhaps she is full young to be much in company.
gardiner s curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication.
she had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years.
but i must tell you how it went off.
she was met in the vestibule by lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, i am glad you are come, for there is such fun here!
gardiner, who was several years younger than mrs.
wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him, said her sister.
was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs.
they could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you.
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage.
have you seen any pleasant men?
on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities.
at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs.
bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner.
gardiner thought of him, and mrs.
what could be the meaning of it?
her ladyship was highly incensed.
a man who has once been refused!
for what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?
bingley, since you went away, said mrs.
i knew you would be wishing me joy.
interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other.
gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder.
when, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr.
by you, i was properly humbled.
oh, my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.
yes, i call it a very easy distance.
and have you heard from him often?
miss bennet s lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening she was his settled choice.
yes; there is nothing in that.
if i can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too.
i thought we never should have got into the coach.
it is at any rate difficult not to extend to her a share of the respect and affection (affection and respect of a peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards mr.
yes; i do comprehend a great deal in it.
no, replied jane, i have not forgotten him; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you.
elizabeth longed to observe that mr.
well, my comfort is, i am sure jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done.
and i have another favour to ask.
my mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!
would you believe it, lizzy, that when he went to town last november he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again?
but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.
not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but themselves.
let me know everything that i am to know without delay.
in point of composition, said mary, his letter does not seem defective.
elizabeth made no objection: the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs.
collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement.
i rather wonder now at your knowing any.
when denny, and wickham, and pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least.
but my feelings are not only cordial towards him, they are even impartial towards miss king.
darcy did not wish for cards, and mr.
their sister s wedding-day arrived; and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself.
bingley, in consequence of it, before they did.
it was melancholy to leave her to such society!
here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell.
respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown.
bennet; and if i were to see you at it, i should take away your bottle directly.
collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family.
but if you will listen to his letter, you may, perhaps, be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.
i must beg, therefore, to be importuned no further on the subject.
of whom does jane ever think ill?
i cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because if he had at all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.
younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them: anything was a welcome relief to him at rosings; and mrs.
but nothing can be done; i know very well that nothing can be done.
i wish i could call her amiable.
and this, said she, is the end of all his friend s anxious circumspection!
everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to charlotte s first sketch.
darcy had walked away to another part of the room.
i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.
this young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the heart of mortal can most desire, splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage.
i have nothing to say against him: he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, i should think you could not do better.
darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent.
if you believed it impossible to be true, said elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.
repeated elizabeth, in utter amazement.
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.
the hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs.
you are a very strange creature by way of a friend!
and accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the parsonage together.
how can you contrive to write so even?
i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.
but with miss austen the myriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.
it was not in their direct road; nor more than a mile or two out of it.
darcy s steward, and of that, i can assure you, he informed me himself.
what pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have!
yet it did, and even the third.
i pity, though i cannot help blaming, her.
i have already told her so once, by your desire.
nonsense, how can you talk so!
darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.
collins has just related as made by himself to lady catherine, may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?
musgrove s self-deceiving regrets over her son.
is he coming home, and without poor lydia?
so, lizzy, said he, one day, your sister is crossed in love, i find.
she is a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.
she was ashamed to think how much.
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make mr.
what s his name that tall, proud man.
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects.
miss bingley was engrossed by mr.
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met.
they walked on without knowing in what direction.
certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger.
but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather s death made her mistress of this fortune?
but these things happen so often!
the moral will be perfectly fair.
i often tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice.
bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.
darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister s proficiency.
the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte s dying an old maid.
collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship s praise into his own hands.
bingley were at piquet, and mrs.
they were of a respectable family in the north of england; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.
she is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and i have no opinion of her.
how much of good or evil must be done by him!
how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year!
are not you curious to hear how it was managed?
my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of of mr.
elizabeth, you are not serious now.
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.
i have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you dare.
speak to lizzy about it yourself.
i thought him very sly; he hardly ever mentioned your name.
collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent.
yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had.
while there was an officer in meryton, they would flirt with him; and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn, they would be going there for ever.
it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.
but i pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it.
it is wonderful, replied wickham; for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend.
society, i own, is necessary to me.
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.
collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon done done while mrs.
they were able to love each other, even as well as they intended.
most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote.
and as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them, after they are married.
and you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.
it may, perhaps, be pleasant, replied charlotte, to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded.
other schemes, too, came into her head.
but the hero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed.
and for this we are to be thankful.
wickham s charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.
hunsford, near westerham, kent, 15th october.
it was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up.
neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane.
your reproof, so well applied, i shall never forget: had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.
bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday, which would exactly finish jane s week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before.
well, he certainly is very agreeable, and i give you leave to like him.
if he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to mrs.
our poor mother is sadly grieved.
she had very little notice from any but him.
you shall have it in a few words.
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time mr.
do let me ask my partner to introduce you.
darcy s indifference; and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that, perhaps, instead of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.
collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.
forster to meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.
i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had.
bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation.
elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.
wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.
and there was my aunt, all the time i was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon.
not that i mean to find fault with you, for such things, i know, are all chance in this world.
very true; and if i had my will we should.
one seems so forlorn without them.
when the gentlemen rose to go away, mrs.
darcy s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.
i wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.
you could not make me happy, and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so.
collins might never make the offer, and, till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.
i found, said he, as the time drew near, that i had better not meet mr.
i deserve neither such praise nor such censure, cried elizabeth; i am not a great reader, and i have pleasure in many things.
yes, and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise.
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; darcy was continually giving offence.
the secret of that charm many men and not a few women, from miss austen herself downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is a thing rather to be felt than to be explained.
he was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied, just as you please.
an airing would do me a great deal of good, i am sure.
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs.
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.
bennet treated the matter differently.
she was not rendered formidable by silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self-importance, and brought mr.
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour.
indeed, mamma, you are mistaken, said elizabeth, blushing for her mother.
she now lost every expectation of pleasure.
one ought not to repine; but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me!
you are rather disposed to call his interference officious?
her keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more; and was grateful to her uncle for saying, there are very few people of whom so much can be said.
of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.
there is nothing like dancing, after all.
she burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word.
but in the first place, he was like him; he is there alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds of prime ministers and archbishops, of metals, semi-metals, and distinguished philosophers.
darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her.
then too she is a perfectly natural girl.
she represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves?
bennet had been to epsom and clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as mr.
i cannot pretend to be sorry, said wickham, after a short interruption, that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with him i believe it does not often happen.
darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection.
when jane and elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of mr.
gardiner left them soon after breakfast.
some acquaintance or other, my dear, i suppose; i am sure i do not know.
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and mr.
his character is thereby complete.
the rapture of lydia on this occasion, her adoration of mrs.
march was to take elizabeth to hunsford.
but surely, said she, i may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars, without his perceiving me.
not so much as i could wish, sir: but i dare say he may spend half his time here; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months.
yes, he went on tuesday, as i wrote you word.
darcy is impatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her again.
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away.
bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.
it does seem, and it is most shocking, indeed, replied elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt.
oh, she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld!
with assumed tranquillity he then replied, i have no wish of denying that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that i rejoice in my success.
we seem to have been designed for each other.
darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr.
it is a pity they are not handsome!
bennet, i am quite delighted with him.
will you allow me, or do i ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton?
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me.
if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is, i shall know what to think.
bingley, said her husband; it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life.
would to heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress!
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage; for mr.
she could think only of her letter.
sir, you quite misunderstand me, said mrs.
how acutely did she now feel it!
to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed, i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about mr.
will you tell me how long you have loved him?
her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.
lady catherine, i have nothing further to say.
collins s conversation to herself.
imprudent as a marriage between mr.
and though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case.
your coming to longbourn, to see me and my family, said elizabeth coolly, will be rather a confirmation of it if, indeed, such a report is in existence.
but do you always write such charming long letters to her, mr.
yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.
how thankful am i, that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves.
jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window she looked she saw mr.
darcy s behaviour astonished and vexed her.
i never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.
i owe all that i know of it to another, not to you.
wickham s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to lydia s for him.
but when you have had time to think it all over, i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done.
the picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were all that remained to be shown.
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent?
in her kind schemes for elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam.
how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it!
but in matters of greater weight, i may suffer from the want of money.
darcy s sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road.
darcy, was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat.
her colour changed, and she said no more.
my dear eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way.
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way.
the girls stared at their father.
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case.
but, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs.
darcy is uncommonly kind to mr.
yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.
elizabeth s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.
but to be candid without ostentation or design, to take the good of everybody s character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad, belongs to you alone.
mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs.
darcy was writing, and miss bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister.
in nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show more affection than she feels.
bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.
she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him.
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that i had known it, and purposely kept it from him.
she finds miss pope a treasure.
nor did that day wear out her resentment.
in what an amiable light does this place him!
darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr.
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.
darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley; and was, consequently, resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas.
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs.
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen him.
such i was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such i might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest elizabeth!
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a scheme of infamy.
it is done, however, and it was done for the best.
gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent.
she is now about miss elizabeth bennet s height, or rather taller.
how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love?
such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expenses, she frequently sent them.
when this was done, she had a less active part to play.
i do not know the particulars, but i know very well that mr.
she put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success.
it is difficult, indeed it is distressing.
your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.
lady catherine, said she, you have given me a treasure.
younger sons cannot marry where they like.
i must beg to return to the house.
my dear hill, have you heard the good news?
elizabeth, equally next to jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.
you get none; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can shape a real impression out of the rest.
affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it everywhere.
it keeps him in good humour, said she, and i am more obliged to you than i can express.
very little was said by either; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and, perhaps, he might be doing the same.
she would not listen, therefore, to her daughter s proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable.
the country, said darcy, can in general supply but few subjects for such a study.
how humiliating is this discovery!
you must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.
one day s delay, she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual.
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.
wickham s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family.
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now; but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable.
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master: she comes here to-morrow with him.
bennet gone away, and i know he will fight wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all?
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede.
and his sisters are charming women.
i was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then i should have gone quite distracted.
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr.
every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable.
his countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.
in the absence of jane, he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and when bingley was gone, jane constantly sought the same means of relief.
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.
miss darcy s praise occupied the chief of it.
these are heavy misfortunes, replied elizabeth.
for i dare not hope, he continued, in a lower and more serious tone, that he is improved in essentials.
darcy, she moved again towards the gate.
the first week of their return was soon gone.
darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.
but is it certain, absolutely certain?
you do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms.
wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions mrs.
his regiment is there; for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.
gardiner, rendered suspicious by elizabeth s warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.
i will take care of myself, and of mr.
of all his sister s falsehood and contrivance!
and do you really know all this?
i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town.
it is difficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife, or when putting mr.
she paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.
they were to be off as soon as possible.
but your family owe me nothing.
denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, mr.
the distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly.
i should not be surprised, said darcy, if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers.
she had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had mr.
the distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles.
hurst was observing their game.
i am far from attributing any part of mr.
she had obtained private intelligence that mr.
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted.
her not objecting does not justify him.
he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room.
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.
he must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on.
hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table but in vain.
this will not do, said elizabeth; you never will be able to make both of them good for anything.
well, cried her mother, it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle?
bennet replied that he had not.
it was a subject which they could not mention before me.
they look upon it quite as their own, i dare say, whenever that happens.
he really believed that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.
we will go as far as meryton with you, said catherine and lydia.
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.
gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.
may we take my uncle s letter to read to her?
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.
and rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not mr.
is her husband, who is the son of his late father s steward, to be his brother?
a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk.
lady catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr.
you taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.
collins changed his mind from jane to elizabeth while mrs.
towards him i have been kinder than towards myself.
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way.
i comfort myself with thinking, replied jane, that he certainly would not marry lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.
i described and enforced them earnestly.
lady catherine seemed pleased.
thank god i have not that pain.
about the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.
this was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr.
oh, cried miss bingley, charles writes in the most careless way imaginable.
darcy is particularly fond of, that i may have it to-morrow.
and when the party entered the assembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: mr.
philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.
ring the bell, kitty, for hill.
she practises very constantly.
my sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother s nephew, colonel fitzwilliam, and myself.
reynolds could interest her on no other point.
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.
from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to mr.
how is such a man to be worked on?
can you possibly guess, lizzy, who is meant by this?
darcy, who sat opposite to them.
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but i will not leave the country without confiding them, and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable.
there is no danger of wickham s marrying mary king there s for you!
they will ruin your happiness.
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.
and then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.
the first wish of my heart, said she to herself, is never more to be in company with either of them.
his debts are to be paid, amounting, i believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her, and his commission purchased.
i have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two.
on the first head she could not make a mistake; her men, though limited, are true, and her women are, in the old sense, absolute.
their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves.
wickham ought not to be a clergyman.
it will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.
the world has been deceived in that respect; and i am happy to say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.
i have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future.
so he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.
the collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, i do not know what we shall do.
bennet had no more to say; and lady lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.
elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was her only alternative.
you are to understand, miss bennet, that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will i be dissuaded from it.
she really looked almost wild.
he promises fairly; and i hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent.
at length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.
darcy, she was directly retreating.
i do not remember her name among the ladies at court.
i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that.
it was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long.
well, then, you need not be under any alarm.
when i consider, she added, in a yet more agitated voice, that i might have prevented it!
as soon as they entered the copse, lady catherine began in the following manner: you can be at no loss, miss bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither.
elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.
ay, that is because you have the right disposition.
her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while mr.
sense and sensibility has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does not want them.
younge was of course removed from her charge.
you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but which i have never acknowledged.
it drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present.
my father and mother believe the worst, but i cannot think so ill of him.
i have faults enough, but they are not, i hope, of understanding.
the goodness of the minor characters in pride and prejudice has been already alluded to, and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties difficult in any space, and impossible in this.
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, i should not pay him half so much deference.
hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed, elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently mr.
to this, mary very gravely replied, far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures.
but here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister s absence, i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized.
society has claims on us all; and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody.
even scott required hill and mountain and ballad, even coleridge metaphysics and german to enable them to chip the classical shell.
he was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.
she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.
but we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.
i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne, for fifty pounds!
oh no it is not for me to be driven away by mr.
but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation.
how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr.
jane was beyond competition her favourite child.
his character was to speak for itself.
i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly.
i will go to meryton, said she, as soon as i am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister philips.
that would be the greatest misfortune of all!
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the room.
he now wished it more than ever.
he did trace them easily to clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney-coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom.
i do not know who is good enough for him.
if it were merely a fine house richly furnished, said she, i should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful.
i admire the activity of your benevolence, observed mary, but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness, and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due.
but you will know it, when i have told you what happened the very next day.
i am happier even than jane; she only smiles, i laugh.
you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage.
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced.
her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as i told lady catherine myself one day, has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament.
the gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice, are you pleased with kent?
he was full of joy and attention.
elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased.
the surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.
elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham s name.
yes if darcy does not put it off again.
he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister s attachment; and she could not help remembering what charlotte s opinion had always been.
and you saw the old housekeeper, i suppose?
you may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire, my dear cousin.
bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him protested that he never read novels h.t feb 94 to read aloud to the ladies.
but i hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.
she could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question and read on.
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr.
consider how important every moment is in such a case.
dearest lizzy, i hardly know what i would write, but i have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.
his disposition must be dreadful.
elizabeth almost stared at her.
in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before.
you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.
gardiner abused her stupidity.
bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and mrs.
and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls.
bingley s heart were entertained.
and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?
and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, and pray, what is the usual price of an earl s younger son?
bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr.
there, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard.
do anything rather than marry without affection.
but it is, returned she; for mrs.
my sister, i am sure, will not hear of her removal.
darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme.
this matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled.
bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and mr.
darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend.
but i can guess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs.
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence: she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.
their powers of conversation were considerable.
his former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them.
into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance.
darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband.
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me.
she had gained her point, and had time to consider of it.
collins, when she draws the moral of lydia s fall.
you know how i detest it, unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner.
she felt that jane s feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility.
elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, to treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!
she has known him only a fortnight.
is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
the communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred.
to the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding mrs.
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation.
compared with some families, i believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means.
it was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention.
she then took a large house in edward street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.
the garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving.
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.
it is from miss bingley, said jane, and then read it aloud.
where shall you change horses?
those who do not complain are never pitied.
bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do.
does your charge give you much trouble?
wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs.
you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.
her carriage remained at the door, and elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it.
bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it.
she resolved to give her the information herself; and therefore charged mr.
but to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.
bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.
we passed each other several times.
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr.
elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself.
you refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.
but slyness seems the fashion.
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you looked up to him as a superior.
or, in other words, you are determined to have him.
why should they not go on to scotland, if that had been the case?
as it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents.
offended two or three young ladies an excellent consolation in its way, said elizabeth; but it will not do for us.
is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year?
bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to london, before they procured lodgings.
bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card.
bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia.
collins could not have been so satisfactorily exhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the figures of mr.
i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.
it was really a very handsome thought.
they have some of the finest woods in the country.
darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done; and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least.
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, go to your father; he wants you in the library.
elizabeth coloured, and said, a little.
but self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.
there were better sense in the sad mechanic exercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not.
the dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing.
she sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door.
it was all pride and insolence.
hurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.
to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you.
darcy it was welcome intelligence: elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough.
collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs.
i have heard from authority, which i thought as good, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.
there is some sense in what he says about the girls, however; and, if he is disposed to make them any amends, i shall not be the person to discourage him.
he resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds.
bennet, impossible, when i am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?
said he; that is rather singular.
elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily settled.
both, replied elizabeth archly; for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds.
he looked serious as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at pemberley.
bingley; but i am sure it will be too much for kitty.
in making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.
hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when mr.
darcy they had only seen at church.
when the party broke up, lydia returned with mrs.
your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as i said before, they had a great deal of talk together.
at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him.
darcy with a very expressive smile.
but georgiana would not join her.
bingley s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham.
i have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude.
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way.
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was.
but before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly: her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to mrs.
how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?
darcy s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.
bennet, for many years after lydia s birth, had been certain that he would.
they could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.
and what is fifty miles of good road?
the dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which mr.
his anxiety for jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others.
darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr.
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being.
i never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them.
she got up and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour.
in talking over their route the evening before, mrs.
his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind.
jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.
collins and maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor.
cheerful prognostics they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them.
darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father s active superintendence; and when, immediately before my father s death, mr.
you could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means.
if i have, i shall be the last person to confess it.
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.
but if you have got them to-day, said elizabeth, my mother s purpose will be answered.
i have written to colonel forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr.
it was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.
her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related.
she had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.
one came from her books, and the other from her toilette.
if one could but go to brighton!
i am perfectly serious in my refusal.
we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side, said jane: i hope and trust they will yet be happy.
the gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas!
miss bingley told me, said jane, that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance.
came on into hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in barnet and hatfield, but without any success, no such people had been seen to pass through.
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.
collins, and the convenient distance of hunsford from london.
the first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, i had detached mr.
i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!
nay, said elizabeth, this is not fair.
it is not quite a week since they left brighton.
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia s general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs.
but, to be sure, the good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character!
elizabeth was not surprised at it, as jane had written the direction remarkably ill.
jones s shopboy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield, because the miss bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards mr.
before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, mrs.
i am sure my sisters must all envy me.
all connection between us seemed now dissolved.
wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more.
forster should not ask me as well as lydia, said she, though i am not her particular friend.
four weeks passed away, and jane saw nothing of him.
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with charlotte, and the kind attention she had received, must make her feel the obliged.
jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.
with these rooms i might have now been familiarly acquainted!
they were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs.
bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could.
if you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.
my dear aunt, how could you think of it?
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions.
you ought all to have learned.
philips s house, and then made their bows, in spite of miss lydia s pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of mrs.
my aunt s intelligence had given me hope, and i was determined at once to know everything.
anxiety on jane s behalf was another prevailing concern; and mr.
what will you think of my vanity?
a person may be proud without being vain.
collins s joints of meat were too large for her family.
we dressed up chamberlayne in woman s clothes, on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun!
they left brighton together on sunday night, and were traced almost to london, but not beyond: they are certainly not gone to scotland.
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr.
and then, said she, if that very improbable event should ever take place, i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.
bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr.
and is such a girl to be my nephew s sister?
collins began, believe me, my dear miss elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.
of the lady s sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.
as they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen.
in the first place, replied mr.
my temper i dare not vouch for.
detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.
his accompanying them was a double advantage: she felt all the compliment it offered to herself; and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.
but elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered, no, no; stay where you are.
and there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much.
darcy s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.
in town, i believe, he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.
in the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron.
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation.
do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?
you have widely mistaken my character, if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these.
she had not been many hours at home, before she found that the brighton scheme, of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.
and so, you like this man s sisters, too, do you?
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes.
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by miss bingley, i can guess the subject of your reverie.
lady catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman, indeed, added charlotte, and a most attentive neighbour.
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match.
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.
collins s addresses, by engaging them towards herself.
everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.
elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr.
don t think me angry, however, for i only mean to let you know, that i had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your side.
except, thought elizabeth, when she goes to ramsgate.
he was on one side of her mother.
cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, i will not detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant, go after mr.
there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies.
your idea of the ponies is delightful.
the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.
my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till thursday with me.
do not give way to useless alarm, added he: though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.
then, observed elizabeth, you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman.
in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure, said bingley; and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.
is this a hint to me, lizzy, said her father, to send for the horses?
elizabeth was surprised, however, that wickham should consent to such a scheme; and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.
darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?
gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both.
what are you telling miss bennet?
i have no right to give my opinion, said wickham, as to his being agreeable or otherwise.
but you are always giving her the preference.
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured.
this must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in summer: the windows are full west.
till elizabeth entered the drawing-room at netherfield, and looked in vain for mr.
that it ought not to be attempted.
she stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.
but now that my dear uncle is come, i hope everything will be well.
and then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it.
her aunt assured her that she was; and elizabeth, having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted, a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented.
well, my dear, said he, when she ceased speaking, i have no more to say.
we may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon.
it was the last of the regiment s stay in meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace.
and if he does, colonel forster will hire him.
i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun.
i am sorry to pain you, but so it was.
bennet and her daughters then departed, and elizabeth returned instantly to jane, leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr.
perhaps, by-and-by, i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but now we may be silent.
there are, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to lady catherine de bourgh, i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.
console lady catherine as well as you can.
he smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.
they were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of that they would have been glad to be certain.
you thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared!
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to jane, while mrs.
for you are a young lady of deep reflection, i know, and read great books, and make extracts.
the express was sent off directly.
my dear charles, what do you mean?
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while mr.
the next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.
five daughters brought up at home without a governess!
these parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not.
perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been that in his voice, which was not like ease.
but i am particularly attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!
bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them.
i now give it to you, if you are resolved on having him.
it is at least remarkable that in two very short periods of writing one of about three years, and another of not much more than five she executed six capital works, and has not left a single failure.
her hopes were answered; jane had not been gone long before it rained hard.
i daresay you believed it; but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity.
it would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of miss bingley s pretended regard.
the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person.
nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece.
oh, cried elizabeth, i am exceedingly diverted.
i do not like to boast of my own child; but to be sure, jane one does not often see anybody better looking.
do not imagine, miss bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.
this is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a daughter, said elizabeth.
you will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and of course she will be always at pemberley with you.
it is such a spur to one s genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind.
colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon.
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, yes, you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that.
she was overpowered by shame and vexation.
said she, as she looked in her face.
i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton?
collins s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes.
you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane.
do you prefer reading to cards?
there is much more difference as to their best work than in the case of those others who are loved by allowance by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and proper thing to love them.
from herself to jane, from jane to bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr.
anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.
darcy is all politeness, said elizabeth, smiling.
bennet; and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.
it is very interesting that we possess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled first draught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in john dashwood.
that is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.
to the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr.
having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.
i do not think we were speaking at all.
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had mrs.
he listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed along.
your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of ignorance.
in anticipating the happiness of bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house.
she is a most charming young lady, indeed.
i think i have heard you say that you know them.
very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family.
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name.
when i went away, i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again!
i remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend, william collins.
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this?
they have each their advantages, and i can be equally happy in either.
i thought i should have broke my heart.
to complete the favourable impression, she then told him what mr.
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first.
oh, how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him!
bennet, with civil self-command, to miss lucas.
all this she must possess, added darcy; and to all she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.
she became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it.
it will save me a world of trouble and economy.
my dear, dear lizzy, i would, i do congratulate you; but are you certain forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?
oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both.
he keeps a man-servant, does he?
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her.
we can all plague and punish one another.
their brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike man he is a great friend of darcy s.
it was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit.
gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.
the horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.
elizabeth replied that it was.
elizabeth felt jane s pleasure.
he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear.
collins s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, if any young men come for mary or kitty, send them in, for i am quite at leisure.
i would go and see her if i could have the carriage.
her sister made not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was opened; and darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it.
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart.
i hope we may often meet again.
as i did the other day, said elizabeth, with a conscious smile; very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that.
the promised letter of thanks from mr.
this preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see mr.
collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance.
reynolds replied, that he was; adding, but we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends.
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced, of what mr.
bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure jane would have caught cold again.
let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.
her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.
she will follow wherever lydia leads.
elizabeth can give at least as good as she gets when she is attacked; but she never scratches, and she never attacks first.
in the second place, it is rash, i think, to conclude that an actual mr.
till i have your disposition, your goodness, i never can have your happiness.
but if we do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, mrs.
i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter.
you must contrive to send somebody.
bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again?
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford, between our pools at quadrille, while mrs.
her ladyship s carriage is regularly ordered for us.
bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether all her sisters were at longbourn.
do clear them, too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.
bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if mr.
elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.
long has just been here, and she told me all about it.
while the family were in this confusion, charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them.
my child, let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life.
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up.
his father, miss bennet, the late mr.
how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!
thank you but i always mend my own.
bingley, and under your orders.
he was well, but so much engaged with mr.
excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.
i fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies.
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man.
one must speak a little, you know.
his pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable, allowing something for fortune and figure.
younge, who was some time ago governess to miss darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what.
oh, jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!
it was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.
an easy distance do you call it?
he spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.
it was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from jane.
bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter.
gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces.
i must conclude, for i cannot be long from my poor mother.
and it was not wholly without foundation.
but afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.
i should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off.
bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.
she felt anew the justice of mr.
he then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister.
bennet s being quite unable to sit alone.
recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.
wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in their corps.
elizabeth had settled it that mr.
repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare.
but, my dear elizabeth, she added, what sort of girl is miss king?
she followed her father to the fireplace, and they both sat down.
neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude, replied elizabeth, has any possible claim on me, in the present instance.
the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment.
his circumstances, he assured me, and i had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad.
darcy danced only once with mrs.
philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley s good-humour encouraged; yet, whenever she did speak, she must be vulgar.
and what sort of young lady is she?
elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr.
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and mrs.
they saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve.
collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.
in every view it is unaccountable!
gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely anything.
to elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self-imposed.
well, all i know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him.
i feel as if i had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.
he only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true.
from elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent.
but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away.
gardiner was so little to be trusted.
was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room, and from all the others when they sat down to table.
your cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings.
but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?
she was at least free from the offence of mr.
what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?
comyns carr in acknowledgment of all i owe to his friendship and advice, these illustrations are gratefully inscribed hugh thomson preface.
yes; and i had heard it before.
and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.
two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.
he was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments.
you are quite a visit in my debt, mr.
i have a high respect for your nerves.
it is, i believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the convenience of the world.
because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford.
balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.
this fine account of him, whispered her aunt as they walked, is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.
did you go by the village of kympton?
oh then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.
he takes them now for people of fashion.
what a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received!
i will have no reserves from you.
bingley likes, said her mother, resentfully, since we are not to visit.
bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said, but is there not danger of lady catherine s disapprobation here, my good sir?
from something that he told me in our journey hither, i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him.
bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to look at netherfield house.
he began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.
nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant.
to kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected.
though it is difficult, said jane, to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit.
to pemberley, therefore, they were to go.
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologized for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within.
but if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required.
miss darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place.
would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.
you have shown him off now much more than he did himself.
his understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently, his wife may teach him.
it is very hard to think that she might have been mr.
whatever my connections may be, said elizabeth, if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you.
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.
collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs.
i know we dine with four-and-twenty families.
the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks.
at present i will say nothing about it.
if it was not for the entail, i should not mind it.
she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.
the wedding took place: the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual.
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose.
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct.
kitty and me were to spend the day there, and mrs.
very true, my dear, that is exactly what i say.
beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose miss darcy, replied jane; but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.
had it been your uncle s doing, i must and would have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own way.
if that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.
as much as i ever wish to be, cried elizabeth, warmly.
and so, i suppose, they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead.
bennet would have stirred the fire), when mr.
it is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of it.
in everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived.
and so, it is quite certain he is coming?
gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.
how does georgiana get on, darcy?
they have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better.
but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties.
i am not going to run away, papa, said kitty, fretfully.
elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at mr.
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.
i was only confused for the moment, because i felt that i should be looked at.
you allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.
only think of its being three months, she cried, since i went away: it seems but a fortnight, i declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time.
elizabeth bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, mr.
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man.
there was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake.
she seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to mary at all.
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications.
his air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal.
bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london, and promised to write again very soon.
wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in london; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her.
but of every other neglect i can believe him capable.
you think it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.
i have a warm unguarded temper, and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too freely.
is nothing due to me on that score?
bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening mrs.
but she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former.
bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good-humour and common politeness of bingley, in half an hour s visit, had revived.
it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane, said she.
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation.
i am going to-morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manners nor sense to recommend him.
elizabeth related to jane, the next day, what had passed between mr.
bennet, replied his wife, how can you be so tiresome?
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was still dear to him.
oh, but the gentlemen will have mr.
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn; and the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time.
said miss bingley: will she be as tall as i am?
collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.
cried elizabeth, when she had finished.
when i went away, i felt that it would soon happen.
yes, and her petticoat; i hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, i am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office.
bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.
bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and, when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.
bingley s name had been last mentioned between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, his mind was not very differently engaged.
my fingers, said elizabeth, do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do.
she was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, i am happy to add, that i owed the knowledge of it to herself.
she certainly did not hate him.
he had, to be sure, done much.
mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father s speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.
i had not believed it possible.
denny had brought him from london, and that he was to have a lieutenant s commission in the shire.
robinson s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest?
he was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party.
but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.
it was all over before i arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been.
his attachment to rosings certainly increases.
and so would anne, if her health had allowed her to apply.
but he found, in reply to this question, that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.
he shall be mercenary, and she shall be foolish.
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but mr.
she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.
if one could but go to brighton!
elizabeth silently attended her.
my uncle is to send a servant for us.
charlotte s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth.
after sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, mr.
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone.
no; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton.
my love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?
on such encouragement to ask, elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.
lady lucas herself has often said so, and envied me jane s beauty.
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in london, than in scotland.
much as i abominate writing, i would not give up mr.
i am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation.
his father was an excellent man, said mrs.
adieu to disappointment and spleen.
i have not forgot, you see; and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement.
with an air of indifference, he soon afterwards added, how long did you say that he was at rosings?
were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
if, in the explanation of them which is due to myself, i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, i can only say that i am sorry.
after breakfast, the girls walked to meryton, to inquire if mr.
wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which i have pledged myself.
bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended mr.
had lydia s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that mr.
in revolving lady catherine s expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference.
do not let us quarrel about the past.
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could.
darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet, and, after sitting a few minutes longer, without saying much to anybody, went away.
i promised them so faithfully!
that is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon i hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance.
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother s in sending it.
no, no; i feel he may defy us there.
are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted?
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.
had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt, to my own family!
at length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.
bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.
you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert.
let us hope for better things.
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy.
thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people s feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business.
here they were interrupted by lady catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of.
bennet s leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master, she could not help saying, o that my dear mother had more command over herself!
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.
there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance!
true; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room.
lydia, my love, ring the bell.
collins will be very glad of your company, i am sure.
while she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her darcy with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.
i will only add, god bless you.
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper.
these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.
well, but now for my news: it is about dear wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?
but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event.
i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours, he coldly replied.
five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and mrs.
i will not admit that one speech or one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled with reality, and i should not wonder if many of these words and actions are historically true.
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.
the country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, mr.
only genius could have made charlotte what she is, yet not disagreeable; wickham what he is, without investing him either with a cheap don juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality.
i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it; i believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as i wished it in reason.
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother s ear.
he is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character.
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; and mr.
for about three years i heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation.
their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this!
i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.
philips s vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, a greater tax on his forbearance; and though mrs.
that he should have been in love with her for so many months!
darcy; but let me not interrupt you, sir.
but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with, i hope mr.
but, no, recollecting herself, that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; i should not have been allowed to invite them.
mamma would like to go, too, of all things!
your list of the common extent of accomplishments, said darcy, has too much truth.
who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly!
of his former way of life, nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told meeting accidentally in town himself.
philips s supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody.
but, she continued, recollecting herself, as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.
the very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.
depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, i will visit them all.
he is nothing to us, you know, and i am sure i never want to see him again.
you may depend upon my seeking no further.
it was in the times and the courier, i know; though it was not put in as it ought to be.
sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.
i mean that no man in his proper senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after i am gone.
i shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy.
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other.
when the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers mr.
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.
on both sides it was only assertion.
elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure.
my aunt, she continued, is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street.
collins was impossible or non-existent at the end of the eighteenth century.
i cannot quite agree with you there.
mary s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected.
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to colonel fitzwilliam, your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word i say.
darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together.
she had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other many weeks.
james s, with very decent composure.
collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.
the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn, and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.
and i am not so certain that i should myself use the word narrow in connection with her.
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation; mr.
miss bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing mr.
darcy that they scarcely ever saw him.
wickham, who left the place immediately, and mrs.
i send no compliments to your mother.
you are not going to introduce yourself to mr.
wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball.
gardiner, that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her.
how are they even to be discovered?
collins was also in the same state of angry pride.
you have delighted us long enough.
and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.
bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast.
elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father s behaviour as a husband.
elizabeth s astonishment was beyond expression.
i should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.
reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.
elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was despatched to longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.
there is nothing he would not do for her.
i am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.
as for myself, it is many, many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner.
she is a very good kind of girl, i believe.
darcy in anything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his two motives.
what could be more natural than his asking you again?
are you out of your senses to be accepting this man?
but when her mother was gone, jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.
collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.
i am going to open the instrument, eliza, and you know what follows.
these are conditions which, considering everything, i had no hesitation in complying with, as far as i thought myself privileged, for you.
she danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.
i flatter myself, at least, that you will be able to do so.
from what he said of miss darcy, i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl.
girls, can i do anything for you in meryton?
at present i am not in love with mr.
but it is fortunate, thought she, that i have something to wish for.
indeed i have, sir, was her answer.
of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt.
their father then went to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.
he and his sisters were well, i hope, when you left london?
though lydia s short letter to mrs.
miss bennet, replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with.
what a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go!
has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham s departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget, as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me.
for my own part, she rejoined, i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her.
but bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own.
well, much good may it do them!
i rather wished than believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal.
one does not know what to think.
bingley s conduct to design, said elizabeth; but, without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error and there may be misery.
kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do.
i was ready to die of laughter.
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr.
nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.
the subject was pursued no further, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.
i am perfectly ready, i assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the ball.
darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.
his own father did not long survive mine; and within half a year from these events mr.
her aunt now called her to look at a picture.
her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all others.
she looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest mary should be singing all night.
their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush.
you take delight in vexing me.
after a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began: in vain have i struggled.
elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case.
hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.
but this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw mr.
she seems perfectly happy, however; and, in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together.
my poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room.
collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.
it makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else.
it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum.
a man who had felt less might.
darcy was attending them to their carriage, miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth s person, behaviour, and dress.
oh, if that is all, i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better.
she then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to kitty, come here, my love, i want to speak to you, took her out of the room.
though suspicion was very far from miss bennet s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.
darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, i believe, very early in life.
the part which i acted is now to be explained.
that is all very proper and civil, i am sure, said mrs.
when the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed.
but in spite of all this fine talking, my dear lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair.
bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.
his most particular friend, you see by jane s account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister.
you may depend on it, replied the other, for mrs.
how you must have hated me after that evening!
and her calling here was prodigiously civil!
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it.
i began to be afraid you would never come back again.
yes, very different; but i think mr.
as she went upstairs to get ready, mrs.
who would have thought she could be so thin and small!
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but i hardly know what i have written.
they insist also on my seeing mr.
it would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression; but their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied.
there are few people whom i really love, and still fewer of whom i think well.
darcy felt their rudeness, and immediately said, this walk is not wide enough for our party.
she does not yet leave her dressing-room.
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton, of whom i shall subjoin a list, according to his information?
after a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time, with it is your turn to say something now, mr.
for herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him, proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself.
he stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady s whispering to elizabeth again, he walked away.
when my eyes were opened to his real character, oh!
everybody was surprised; and darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away.
it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se nnight.
the favour of your company has been much felt, i assure you.
it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than mrs.
this was one point, with regard to lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and mr.
vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously.
i beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.
but if you are really innocent and ignorant, i must be more explicit.
for, though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody.
his family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her.
she plays and sings all day long.
wickham, of course, wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.
you will be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you!
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.
darcy, cried a young lucas, who came with his sisters, i should not care how proud i was.
said jane, as she finished it.
can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand?
lady lucas began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter had ever so much love and eloquence excited before, how many years longer mr.
spectator, and in jane austen s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was masculine.
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.
miss bennet, i am shocked and astonished.
how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning, mr.
he had rather hoped that all his wife s views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear.
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter.
can there be any other opinion on the subject?
the note was immediately despatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event, or any particular person; for though they each, like elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with mr.
about a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in london; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate; and thither also went mr.
darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself.
and so ended his affection, said elizabeth, impatiently.
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.
pray forgive me, if i have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p.
darcy to me, pray, that i should be afraid of him?
i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want.
darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley!
she had never perceived, while the regiment was in hertfordshire, that lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody.
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.
to convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point.
have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?
darcy, with such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her.
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when mrs.
scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings.
bennet to her husband, and all the others equally well married, i shall have nothing to wish for.
but, however, that shan t prevent my asking him to dine here, i am determined.
my style of writing is very different from yours.
after a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, i do remember his boasting one day, at netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.
he made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton.
it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush.
collins knew not what to make of him.
wickham will soon be gone; and, therefore, it will not signify to anybody here what he really is.
i could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for purvis lodge, the attics are dreadful.
in future, i hope we shall be always of one mind.
not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them.
it will pass away soon enough.
you know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.
bennet followed her, saying, i am quite sorry, lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself; but i hope you will not mind it.
no one but jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation.
the wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this.
my dear lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.
she answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.
though elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a moment s deliberation, i am not.
well, monday morning came, and i was in such a fuss!
i say no more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows him, replied the other.
the journey would, moreover, give her a peep at jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.
it is excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person that we all like.
she had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be mr.
no, no; stay where you are copyright 1894 by george allen.
collins, and i will never see you again if you do.
bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage.
lady catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way.
bennet; and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you.
but, lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or jane at most.
as the day of his arrival drew near, i begin to be sorry that he comes at all, said jane to her sister.
you are a good girl, he replied, and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled.
yes; but when questioned by him, denny denied knowing anything of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.
for my part, i am inclined to believe it all mr.
darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, lord ; and, to the great surprise of all the party, when mr.
there could not exist in the world two men over whom mr.
long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.
darcy by character perfectly well.
her answer was warmly in his favour.
collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another, of which we have been advertised by the same authority.
well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr.
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this.
i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?
gardiner could not be seen; and mr.
i am grieved, indeed, cried darcy: grieved shocked.
it is really too distressing, i am sure you must feel it so.
her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.
let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.
collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane; but, as he took up his abode with the lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs.
lizzy, cried her mother, remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.
wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from longbourn would come in the evening.
may i ask to what these questions tend?
bingley was the principal spokesman, and miss bennet the principal object.
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her, the worth of each was eclipsed by mr.
do not distress me by the idea.
i am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately.
darcy handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.
jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and, excepting a sore throat and a headache, there is not much the matter with me.
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading mr.
only think of that, my dear: he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time.
i cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family.
if he had another motive, i am sure it would never disgrace him.
how shall we punish him for such a speech?
but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.
collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for mrs.
she felt that she had no business at pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.
that he should even speak to her was amazing!
not handsome enough to dance with!
bingley, she could not make a very favourable answer.
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.
there has been many a one, i fancy, overcome in the same way.
and if i am that choice, why may not i accept him?
i am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and could say much on the subject, but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate.
was not this some excuse for incivility, if i was uncivil?
the quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of happiness!
the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter.
i shall walk to meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when mr.
there was another reason, too, for her opposition.
and, taking her hand, he would have given it to mr.
bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.
he simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all.
forster, said she, it will be quite shocking to send her away!
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling.
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn.
darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in spite of all miss bingley s witticisms on fine eyes.
compliments always take you by surprise, and me never.
he is just what a young-man ought to be, said she, sensible, good-humoured, lively; and i never saw such happy manners!
she knew not how to support herself, and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour.
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.
that is a question which i hardly know how to answer.
i know how much you dislike him.
and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?
darcy, there is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge, and i shall keep mine to swell my song.
but when they had withdrawn, he said to her, mrs.
darcy smiled; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh.
i did not expect such a compliment.
philips s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the invitation.
let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.
bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed, good lord!
gardiner has done for them, because wickham has not sixpence of his own.
he sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits.
she could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success.
his guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same, said elizabeth, angrily; for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr.
bingley, who seems good-humour itself, and is, i really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?
do let us have a little music, cried miss bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share.
darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words.
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner of talking to her brother.
bennet s visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.
bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc.
gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning.
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park, when he put his letter into her hand!
upon my word, said her ladyship, you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.
darcy s further notice: though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.
bingley, she added; for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned.
it is of all subjects my delight.
as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.
i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit.
it must have been his sisters doing.
could she have seen half as much love in mr.
collins, you must send a servant with them.
jones should be sent for early in the morning, if miss bennet were not decidedly better.
bennet s expectations were fully answered.
it has been my own doing, and i ought to feel it.
bennet, i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age.
ay, so it is, cried her mother, and mrs.
there is something very pompous in his style.
hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother s conversation with miss bennet.
it was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for longbourn, before she told her sister of mr.
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs.
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister s room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from mr.
miss austen, too, drew back when the white frost touched her shoes; but i think she would have made a pretty good journey even in a black one.
and your assurance of it, i suppose, carried immediate conviction to him.
bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.
her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, i never could perceive anything extraordinary in them.
nay, if you are so serious about it, i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled.
gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.
bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
cried wickham, with a look which did not escape her.
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances; and to have mr.
this was not very consoling to mrs.
bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.
his sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.
why should they try to influence him?
oh, no, no this is not likely.
young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life.
and that, i suppose, is one of your sisters?
they returned, therefore, in good spirits to longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brighton.
he has been accused of many faults at different times; but this is the true one.
and what do you think she said besides?
shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her?
i am glad i brought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another band-box!
i am sure i shall break mine, said lydia.
she related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture in vain.
now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence?
i am quite well, i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn.
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy.
forster, and kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!
if he does not come to me, then, said she, i shall give him up for ever.
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way.
but he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief.
forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.
he will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.
neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight.
rushworth, a coup de théâtre; it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the story earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects, elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying, i am astonished at his intimacy with mr.
sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion.
my feelings will not be repressed.
i am very glad to hear such a good account of her, said lady catherine; and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal.
not that i have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody.
yes, ma am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor.
the letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him.
from that moment i observed my friend s behaviour attentively; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him.
your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.
that is his notion of christian forgiveness!
you have a house in town, i conclude?
we have heard nothing from town.
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected.
he could even listen to sir william lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st.
arguments are too much like disputes.
he was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.
at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr.
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the coveys for you.
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew s letter, that charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over.
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quietly at longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.
my dear lizzy, you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.
he then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his information.
whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of mr.
you give me fresh life and vigour.
her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.
they entered the breakfast room charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where mrs.
but still he would be her husband.
elizabeth read on: i have seen them both.
happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over!
upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except netherfield.
by nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at st.
and then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.
you cannot have been always at longbourn.
he then said, i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly.
i can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?
what you ask, said elizabeth, is no sacrifice on my side; and mr.
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer.
i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had.
i thank you again and again, for not going to the lakes.
as for the gentleman himself, his feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence.
and if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice.
and so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.
reynolds respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant; and since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt: but i hope this may be false.
that, that is the worst of all.
as a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess.
but our visitor was very obstinate.
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in.
and in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away.
wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.
but everybody is to judge for themselves, and the lucases are a very good sort of girls, i assure you.
elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.
the invitation was accepted, of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine s drawing-room.
and do you impute it to either of those?
elizabeth could bear it no longer.
at such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw mr.
darcy, for now they do appear wholly undeserved.
did you see him while you were at lambton?
bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr.
his belief of her sister s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice.
collins s pretty friend had, moreover, caught his fancy very much.
that is capital, added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.
but, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother s.
yes, she called yesterday with her father.
and i think you will agree with me, in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece s.
our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia s character.
wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantel-piece.
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.
they had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.
always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody!
undoubtedly, replied darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and mrs.
soon after their return, a letter was delivered to miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and was opened immediately.
the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger.
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh, and of her mother, lady catherine.
and gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when elizabeth called out, dear ma am, do not go.
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to mrs.
bingley comes, my dear, said mrs.
the day passed much as the day before had done.
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr.
whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.
in spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.
you have liked many a stupider person.
poor lydia s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful.
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast.
were the questions with which she amused herself.
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people, he knew, but he had never seen anything but affability in her.
but above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good-will which could not be overlooked.
she wrote even to jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard.
oh, but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption!
for we must attribute this happy conclusion, she added, in a great measure to his kindness.
with many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter, to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for mrs.
but the likeness of quality consists in a great number of common subdivisions of quality demureness, extreme minuteness of touch, avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects.
bennet s visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library.
unless where they like women of fortune, which i think they very often do.
it will then be publicly seen, that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.
hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend mr.
collins himself, has been charged with exaggeration.
bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party.
she liked him too little to care for his approbation.
if he had not had a family of his own, i and my children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him except a few presents.
i do not think it is very pretty; but i thought i might as well buy it as not.
jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or hearing from caroline.
to the little town of lambton, the scene of mrs.
with his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.
she wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen miss bingley.
she held out her hand: he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.
wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his making friends; whether he may be equally capable of retaining them, is less certain.
collins for a few moments, he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh.
this is no very striking resemblance of your own character, i am sure, said he.
the elopement of lydia and wickham is not, like that of crawford and mrs.
lydia came to us, and wickham had constant admission to the house.
darcy s objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all, and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure.
darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.
and having to relate such a thing of his sister!
he is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.
my motive for cautioning you is as follows: we have reason to imagine that his aunt, lady catherine de bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.
that is to say, you had given your permission.
the plot, though not elaborate, is almost regular enough for fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident could be retrenched without loss to the story.
the eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was elizabeth s intimate friend.
elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly; and, after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting.
at length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.
indeed, jane, you ought to believe me.
it had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when mrs.
i talked about the dance, and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.
i have found out, said he, by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation to my patroness.
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister s warm affection.
her power was sinking; everything must sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.
it is impossible that he should still love me.
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.
next time you call, said she, i hope we shall be more lucky.
you have only proved by this, cried elizabeth, that mr.
kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters.
dear sir, i must trouble you once more for congratulations.
but, perhaps, he could not in her mother s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.
i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.
he was not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in derbyshire.
find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to hunsford, and i will visit her.
you must send john with the young ladies, mrs.
you know not what you are about.
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.
she wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, this must be false!
jane looked well, and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them.
it is more than i engage for, i assure you.
bennet was quite in the fidgets.
darcy returned within the stated time.
do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense?
there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law.
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr.
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of lydia s leaving home.
but i know the foundation is unjust.
since her father s death her home has been london, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education.
i think everything has passed off uncommonly well, i assure you.
she has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to anne s.
she seems a very pleasant young woman, said bingley.
if, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days, she added, i shall know how to understand it.
darcy had been overrated, elizabeth had never yet answered mrs.
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too!
but however insincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so.
i should like balls infinitely better, she replied, if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.
darcy was punctual in his return, and, as lydia informed you, attended the wedding.
the insipidity, and yet the noise the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these people!
wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony.
you certainly do, she replied with a smile; but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome.
with a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what had happened at netherfield.
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did.
it would be nothing; i could see him with perfect indifference; but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.
however, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.
pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen!
not one party, or scheme, or anything!
wickham is by no means a respectable young man.
by this time she is actually with them!
jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to elizabeth.
we were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.
collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him.
from what we have seen of him, continued mrs.
what a contrast between him and his friend!
it was my brother gardiner s drawing up, too, and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it.
the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park, her ladyship s residence.
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes.
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr.
but of this answer lydia heard not a word.
what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?
perhaps it would have been better, replied her sister.
darcy in a most infamous manner.
in the evening, soon after mr.
lady catherine de bourgh s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable.
in this danger kitty is also comprehended.
there was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him.
i could hardly keep my countenance.
but he is a liberal master, i suppose, and that, in the eye of a servant, comprehends every virtue.
i dislike it very much, he replied; but it must be done.
the lucases are very artful people, indeed, sister.
we know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode.
you are all kindness, madam; but i believe we must abide by our original plan.
my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this.
i never met with anybody who delighted me so much.
annesley to miss darcy had been given, to remind her of her post.
he is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane.
if you mention my name at the bell, you will be attended to.
gardiner added, in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was saturday.
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless mr.
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange.
i am sure you will be very comfortable there.
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.
here again i cannot go with the objectors.
his understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.
upon my word, sir, cried elizabeth, your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration.
sir william, how can you tell such a story?
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement.
after watching her a little, fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go, merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new comers.
he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn.
said jane, faintly smiling; you must know, that, though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, i could not hesitate.
darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift.
it was not all settled before monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to longbourn.
your picture may be very exact, louisa, said bingley; but this was all lost upon me.
we were talking of music, madam, said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.
if you have not been mistaken here, i must have been in an error.
no; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called.
had his character been known, this could not have happened.
in a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.
you know i always speak my mind, and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.
darcy s pleasure, in the bingleys invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr.
gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family; jane heard them with horror.
she explained what its effects on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.
bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk.
lady catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to darcy, miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a london master.
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world.
gracechurch street, monday, august 2.
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield.
bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.
jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh s footstool, that she said, mr.
his complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature.
i have spent four days in the same house with him, and i think him very disagreeable.
intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.
i never saw anyone so shocked.
gardiner could not but be deeply affected.
elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.
more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed.
but no such recollection befriended her.
he smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate.
i certainly have not the talent which some people possess, said darcy, of conversing easily with those i have never seen before.
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters, elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day.
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, mr.
and yet, upon my honour, i believed what i said of myself to be true, and i believe it at this moment.
who could about such a nasty little freckled thing?
yes; he introduced us to his sister.
by all means, cried bingley; let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more weight in the argument, miss bennet, than you may be aware of.
bingley, said her mother, i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr.
they will never be distressed for money.
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident.
miss bingley s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.
there is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much.
he was too happy, however, to need much attention; and, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company.
she looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at darcy, who continued, however, impenetrably grave.
till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance.
calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home instantly.
darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me.
i, who have prided myself on my discernment!
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.
were it certain that lady catherine would think so, said mr.
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking.
chiswick press: charles whittingham and co.
oh, charlotte says she hardly ever does.
this she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother s proposal; and it was settled that mr.
if i were to go through the world, i could not meet with a better.
do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart.
he was a tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty.
and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason.
your great men often are; and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds.
it was hardly enough; but it pleased her.
kitty is slight and delicate, and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on.
through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated; and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.
more than once did elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet mr.
i do not believe she often sees such at home.
miss bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room.
what i have to say relates to poor lydia.
said elizabeth, still addressing colonel fitzwilliam.
but, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy, who had been set up as a rival to jane.
philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with her longbourn nieces.
she is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but i will make her know it.
darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin s corroboration.
i only hope they may have half my good luck.
i should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.
he wrote last week to hurry my return.
it is all for jane s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.
but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr.
yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over.
from the entrance hall, of which mr.
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases; and again, during the chief of the day, was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr.
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.
gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure; but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.
he was most highly esteemed by mr.
you began the evening well, charlotte, said mrs.
i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.
she wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise.
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did i receive in the meantime.
you must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much.
the far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances.
a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago.
they were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit.
i do, indeed, replied elizabeth, colouring.
darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam, i was ignorant of the truth myself.
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing.
collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear.
bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.
i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony.
your mother must have been quite a slave to your education.
these causes must be stated, though briefly.
we will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen.
and men take care that they should.
yes, i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care.
well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home.
but these are not jane s feelings; she is not acting by design.
she must own that she was tired of great houses: after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.
allowing for the common demands of the game, mr.
tease calmness of temper and presence of mind!
miss darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed.
they are descended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father s, from respectable, honourable, and ancient, though untitled, families.
for your sake, turning to charlotte, i am glad of it; but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.
hurst began again, i have an excessive regard for jane bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and i wish with all my heart she were well settled.
it was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.
a thousand things may arise in six months.
i am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject.
but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham?
yes, that is what makes it amusing.
mrs bennet and her two youngest girls.
do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.
if he no longer cares for me, why silent?
in a few days more, we may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost.
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr.
i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.
bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well.
to be sure, london was rather thin, but, however, the little theatre was open.
darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued, i have every reason in the world to think ill of you.
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.
wickham had received his commission before he left london, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.
nothing in even our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of his demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of pemberley.
collins s character, connections, and situation in life, i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.
her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable.
what a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.
lydia laughed, and said, ay, that is just like your formality and discretion.
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.
the present always occupies you in such scenes does it?
darcy, she saw, on looking up, that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her.
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to miss darcy, without calling her attention.
they both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open, and their visitor entered.
darcy has not made him just to you.
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?
any place would do of about three or four hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to mr.
there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself.
pardon me for interrupting you, madam, cried mr.
he bore it, however, with admirable calmness.
my dear charlotte, impossible!
darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr.
what relates to yourself is as follows: having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs.
bennet had been down stairs, but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high.
the conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then we have both, i hope, improved in civility.
now i am quite happy, said she, for you will be as happy as myself.
however, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves.
can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
the suspicions which had just arisen of mr.
i have just had a letter from jane, with such dreadful news.
bennet, said she, it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that i should be forced to make way for her, and live to see her take my place in it!
it is evident by this, added jane, that he comes back no more this winter.
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o clock.
but vanity, not love, has been my folly.
forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home.
lydia was lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless.
it will be her turn soon to be teased, said miss lucas.
collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.
he arranges the business just as he pleases.
the housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.
that is the place to get husbands.
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd!
is not this an agreeable surprise?
oh, lizzy, why am i thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all?
darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.
it was the second week in may, in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of , in hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where mr.
and, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road.
their visitors stayed with them above half an hour; and when they arose to depart, mr.
since her being at lambton, she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy.
your friend performs delightfully, he continued, after a pause, on seeing bingley join the group; and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, mr.
i cannot misunderstand you, but i entreat you, dear lizzy, not to pain me by thinking that person to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk.
long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: i like them prodigiously.
it should not be said, that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.
i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance.
bennet; but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it.
i want to know, said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister s, what you have learnt about mr.
collins, cried elizabeth, with some warmth, you puzzle me exceedingly.
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship.
ay, there she comes, continued mrs.
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light.
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side.
i have not been accustomed to such language as this.
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first.
easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings, which in so small a circle must be important.
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?
when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?
he dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday.
when they were gone, elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr.
i should have been most in love with beatrix and argemone; i should, i think, for mere occasional companionship, have preferred diana and barbara.
in pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered meryton.
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?
nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination, said elizabeth.
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.
bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?
again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.
she was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.
and when we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything.
and yours, he replied, with a smile, is wilfully to misunderstand them.
bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.
and pray may i ask but checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, is it in address that he improves?
they have both, said she, been deceived, i dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea.
there was certainly at this moment, in elizabeth s mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance.
bennet coolly observed, from all that i can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country.
bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, if that disagreeable mr.
i pity you, miss eliza, for this discovery of your favourite s guilt; but really, considering his descent, one could not expect much better.
how anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one s own daughters i cannot understand; and all for the sake of mr.
elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.
he is as fine a fellow, said mr.
to this speech bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend s vulgar relations.
you may depend upon my not mentioning it.
without a governess, you must have been neglected.
had i known what i ought, what i dared to do!
he sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room.
i should not mind anything at all.
yes, in conjunction with his friend.
added elizabeth; safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune.
you must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what i say.
i beg you will not put it into lizzy s head to be vexed by his ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.
lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband s regiment happens to be so far off.
but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.
haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week.
you are a gentleman s daughter.
this must be the grossest falsehood!
haye park might do, said she, if the gouldings would quit it, or the great house at stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but ashworth is too far off.
bennet, looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at york, provided she can have her own way.
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party.
she did not choose it, said her daughter; she would go.
we were married, you know, at st.
gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green, something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w.
he joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their aunt s, where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were well talked over.
caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter.
when that business was over, he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music.
wickham s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.
but no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which mrs.
collins came up to them, and told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.
lady catherine seemed resigned.
we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening, said elizabeth.
collins was settled near her family.
bingley will not be detained in london by them.
sir william had been delighted with him.
her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.
bennet was quite disconcerted.
robinson: did not i mention it to you?
as a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people s happiness were in his guardianship!
darcy is engaged to my daughter.
perhaps he thought her too young.
have you any other objection, said elizabeth, than your belief of my indifference?
i wonder what he can be doing there.
the period of expectation was now doubled.
bennet and kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what elizabeth felt.
and can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?
darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.
hurst s gown here she was interrupted again.
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr.
and when you have given your ball, she added, i shall insist on their giving one also.
collins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive.
i had often seen him in love before.
they must be a great loss to your family.
elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.
wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as jane s.
but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much.
he begged pardon for having displeased her.
you shall not defend her, though it is charlotte lucas.
my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr.
i will answer for it, he never cared three straws about her.
collins s respectability, and charlotte s prudent, steady character.
at length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said, and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting!
perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house, whichever it might be, where mr.
as for wickham and lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters.
it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy; but she is too much like her brother, very, very proud.
is not general incivility the very essence of love?
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing!
i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say.
at any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life.
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate!
collins joining in, observed, yes, miss elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church, and i need not say you will be delighted with her.
i will not tell you what it is.
gardiner, there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland.
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.
very well; that reply will do for the present.
every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight.
but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge?
she is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, i understand, highly accomplished.
the apothecary came when breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for jane.
on entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided.
you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing.
shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?
about ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged.
no officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village.
allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer.
had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr.
pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.
oh, said lydia, stoutly, i am not afraid; for though i am the youngest, i m the tallest.
while these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of elizabeth s feelings was every moment increasing.
bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected.
lizzy declares she will not have mr.
collins s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.
we shall often meet, i hope, in hertfordshire.
i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, i imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe.
but i am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.
he comes down on thursday, at the latest, very likely on wednesday.
elizabeth could not help saying, it is very much to his credit, i am sure, that you should think so.
wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.
elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it.
the officers of the shire copyright 1894 by george allen.
but it is of small importance.
he, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry.
i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister.
to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?
i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these.
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had happened in london, mr.
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax mr.
bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him.
hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of.
his daughter s request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north, received at first an absolute negative.
lady catherine, i believe, did a great deal to it when mr.
but she contented herself with and one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as i think you said, in the closest manner.
no, lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame.
darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his i have not an instant to lose concern, and observe her in compassionate silence.
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon.
elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.
there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire.
why, i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley.
it may do very well for the others, replied mr.
her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines.
i should like to know how he behaves among strangers.
when he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on; and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on mr.
a long dispute followed this declaration; but mr.
i do not know: i hope there was.
their situation was awkward enough; but hers she thought was still worse.
no, kitty, i have at least learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it.
i was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction.
jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed.
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed; and while her courage was high, she immediately said, mr.
bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before.
was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane, while she was ill at netherfield?
how much i shall have to tell!
bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if i recollect right, he went but the day before.
collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, now, i do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let mr.
bingley met them with hopes that mrs.
but you have chosen your fault well.
she is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.
bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.
but if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing miss bingley s voice, elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family.
collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings.
philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.
lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, i dare say mr.
bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.
the younger ones out before the elder are married!
by tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and mr.
i must have employment and society.
the day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.
and upon elizabeth s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added, lizzy, i insist upon your staying and hearing mr.
you are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.
bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure.
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is.
i should like it beyond anything!
did you speak from your own observation, said she, when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?
i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love, said darcy.
a glass of wine; shall i get you one?
and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good, added kitty.
other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose fordyce s sermons.
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time.
how could i be so silly as to wish it!
resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all: the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been, in early preferment; and, i trust, i am resigned.
i am perfectly convinced by it that mr.
let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.
how much sooner one tires of anything than of a book!
darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.
miss lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.
gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from mr.
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for mrs.
i inquired after their brother, of course.
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball and at this ball, what do you think he did?
you may depend upon it, madam, said miss bingley, with cold civility, that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us.
i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself.
there is nothing else to be done.
he did look at it, and into it, for half an hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.
wickham has deserved much less attention from mr.
your tempers are by no means unlike.
hurst looked at her with astonishment.
collins s correspondence for any consideration.
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that i am not afraid of requesting it, though i have still something more to ask of the former.
bennet as much as possible, saying not much to elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.
bennet rang the bell, and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library.
charlotte is an excellent manager, i dare say.
collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but mr.
bennet, by talking in this way?
i see what you are feeling, replied charlotte; you must be surprised, very much surprised, so lately as mr.
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between mr.
i know it all; that the young man s marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle.
but make a virtue of it by all means.
a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing.
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth.
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery.
darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me.
darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?
i am afraid you will be angry.
supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?
gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband s.
the day of his and lydia s departure soon came; and mrs.
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone.
some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me.
how can you be so silly, cried her mother, as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt!
we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house, of which i hope you will approve.
collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by charlotte s evident enjoyment of it, elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.
one has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility: mr.
they are going to be encamped near brighton; and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer!
bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that, as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to longbourn.
they are in the same profession, you know, only in different lines.
you and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.
i desire you will stay where you are.
bennet we have glanced at, and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely amusing or more horribly true.
i speak nothing but the truth.
and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight s time.
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.
we may as well leave them by themselves, you know, said her mother as soon as she was in the hall.
well, i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr.
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information.
darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.
elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.
the necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.
how near it may be to mine, i cannot pretend to say.
are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?
i knew how it would be i knew he would manage everything.
but it ought to be done; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly.
i am sorry to hear that; but why did you not tell me so before?
we will go round the park every day.
she is quite a little creature.
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?
her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating, why is he so altered?
at four o clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman, said mr.
philips, the lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called mrs.
the general prejudice against mr.
i hope they will not meet at all.
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley s inattention.
the officers will find women better worth their notice.
bingley her sister s being in town.
bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.
lydia s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten: every sister except mary agreed to go with her; and mr.
were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.
the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said, they never saw so fat a haunch.
darcy of pemberley, and lady anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.
he was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, mr.
elizabeth said no more; but her mind could not acquiesce.
i do not at all know; but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield.
let me hear from you very soon.
it distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage.
on being made acquainted with the present mr.
darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life!
jenkinson to make up her party.
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life.
elizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest downstairs.
but such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.
bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.
a lady s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment.
a great many indeed, said her companion, with a sigh.
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, mr.
of this she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.
gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in london the very next day, and would assist mr.
on the evening before my going to london, said he, i made a confession to him, which i believe i ought to have made long ago.
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.
astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.
they were ignorant, idle, and vain.
but i have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world.
that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to mrs.
the whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention.
wickham by each of them; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring and boast of being married to mrs.
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.
she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before.
i have no reason, i assure you, said he, to be dissatisfied with my reception.
oh, certainly, cried his faithful assistant, no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with.
bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield, which was fixed for the following tuesday.
but do not imagine that he is always here so often.
i will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.
then showing her purchases, look here, i have bought this bonnet.
my feelings in every respect forbid it.
not at all, was her answer; but, depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it.
i admire all my three sons-in-law highly, said he.
hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.
but if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal it, he must find it out.
darcy s explanation there had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.
i often think, said she, that there is nothing so bad as parting with one s friends.
next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.
but at least it shows that she was serious in the object of her journey.
their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency.
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
no, i should have turned in a moment.
but, my dear lydia, i don t at all like your going such a way off.
it only shows her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling.
louisa, you will not mind my waking mr.
darcy s, but you shall do as you choose.
but you see that jane, said her aunt, does not think so ill of wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.
there was no arguing upon such a project.
this is a wretched beginning, indeed!
her report was highly favourable.
elizabeth merely courtesied to him, without saying a word.
they have at least that advantage.
collins was wishing to marry you.
darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.
my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me.
yes; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.
he owns it himself without disguise.
consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr.
oh, my dear lydia, she cried, when shall we meet again?
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, jane and kitty followed, but lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and charlotte, detained first by the civility of mr.
bennet, delighted to speak to a lady catherine.
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in further justification of mr.
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house.
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield.
all was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.
with three younger sisters grown up, replied elizabeth, smiling, your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of mr.
these two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber.
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone.
i am talking of possibilities, charles.
if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.
elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives.
bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, i am sure you did.
bingley for his kindness to jane, with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy.
but, lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.
no, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.
i wonder that the very pride of this mr.
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share.
darcy s civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.
he has children of his own, and may have more.
have not you always hated him?
another day i will do the same; i will sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as i can, or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away.
how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!
lady catherine, said she, you have given me a treasure.
gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed; i have not an instant to lose.
gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how she, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but elizabeth had turned away her head.
the miss webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours.
bingley might like you the best of the party.
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them, said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak.
i hope you will drink to our good journey.
upon the whole, i am much pleased with him.
bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother.
she supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter.
their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr.
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to begin.
collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said, i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case you may be sure of my pardon.
there is nothing the matter with me.
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her.
but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and i dare say very agreeable.
choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for my sake, and for your own; let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way.
but, lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.
bennet instantly answered, oh dear!
her father had been an attorney in meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.
the park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.
bingley must be down again in the summer.
the prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible.
darcy, she left elizabeth to walk by herself.
not that i am afraid of myself, but i dread other people s remarks.
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.
he did not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.
and on the gentlemen s approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper, the men shan t come and part us, i am determined.
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford, every eye was in search of the parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.
bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither mr.
the loo table, however, did not appear.
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman s family.
we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!
she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown.
he saw wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia.
it was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return.
bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.
the advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.
but these, i suppose, are precisely what you are without.
if we thought alike of miss bingley, replied jane, your representation of all this might make me quite easy.
he meant, i believe, replied jane, to go to epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if anything could be made out from them.
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy s meditated elopement.
i can answer your question, said fitzwilliam, without applying to him.
collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure.
you will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that mr.
jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than elizabeth had expected.
hurst and miss bingley; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it.
write to me very often, my dear.
i want to talk very seriously.
here you are in your own family.
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.
in this room they were received by miss darcy, who was sitting there with mrs.
people do not die of little trifling colds.
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it.
you deserve no such attention.
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.
colonel fitzwilliam s manners were very much admired at the parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings.
but on her returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her.
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs.
gardiner; but perhaps, to the lakes.
it was an animating subject, and mrs.
darcy is over, i presume, said miss bingley; and pray what is the result?
he danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.
but, really, i know not what to say.
but, my dear, you must indeed go and see mr.
bennet, when elizabeth had read the note aloud, if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr.
cried elizabeth; but how could that be?

collins, was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr.
it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before.
long, said miss lucas, but i wish he had danced with eliza.
when alone with elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.
my excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to mr.
the visit was returned in due form.
the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs.
she has been doing everything in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater what shall i call it?
we cannot suppose he would help it, if he could.
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply.
my dear, dear aunt, she rapturously cried, what delight!
i do not know when i have been more shocked, said she.
it is a great comfort to have you so rich; and when you have nothing else to do, i hope you will think of us.
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady s attention which could furnish her with an occasion for dictating to others.
she danced four dances with him at meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times.
her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.
how good it was in you, my dear mr.
you refuse, then, to oblige me.
cried jane, what do you mean, sir?
bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.
bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.
this was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!
if he means to be but little at netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there.
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs.
allow me to say, lady catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged.
much as i respect them, i believe i thought only of you.
i want to be told whether i ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham s character.
bennet s invention was again at work to get everybody away from him and her daughter.
lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.
to make herself agreeable to all in seeing bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!
he was always to have gone on saturday, and to saturday he still meant to stay.
but does not jane correspond with his sister?
oh, brother, how kind you are!
long has promised to introduce him.
of neither darcy nor wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.
and till colonel forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, i suppose, of their being really married?
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them, that mr.
bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane.
yes, my youngest is not sixteen.
bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.
oh yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well; and by that time, most likely, captain carter would be at meryton again.
his regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be suspected by jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show mrs.
darcy, drawing near elizabeth, said to her, do you not feel a great inclination, miss bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?
it was the favourite wish of his mother, as well as of hers.
the gentlemen did approach: and when mr.
widely different was the effect of a second perusal.
collins, who, when i am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.
both sisters were uncomfortable enough.
you do not blame me, however, for refusing him?
my mother was in hysterics; and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done.
bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr.
miss bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to leave her room.
but it is all, all too late now.
we are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the éclat of a proverb.
collins s letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters.
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.
darcy was condemned as the worst of men.
darcy s character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.
copyright 1894 by george allen.
in her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.
when at length they arose to take leave, mrs.
she had ventured only one glance at darcy.
bingley to do, he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine s visit.
before any answer could arrive from mr.
i wonder, said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.
when first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were.
but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves.
darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents.
when they repaired to the dining-room, elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.
i should as soon call her mother a wit.
bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party.
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter.
how rich and how great you will be!
hurst soon found even his open petition rejected.
i believe her to be both in a great degree, replied wickham; i have not seen her for many years; but i very well remember that i never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.
my mother would have no objection, but my father hates london.
i will make no promise of the kind.
he deserves to be publicly disgraced.
you persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?
at length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while mrs.
collins was eloquent in her praise.
come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia s folly.
they will take care not to outrun their income.
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.
how i should like to be married before any of you!
and your defect is a propensity to hate everybody.
jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.
now, kitty, you may cough as much as you choose, said mr.
addison and in miss austen there is, though a restrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in roasting and cutting up a fool.
said he, taking the letter from his pocket; but perhaps you would like to read it.
collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.
now, lizzy, i think i have surprised you.
i like her appearance, said elizabeth, struck with other ideas.
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs.
a place, too, with which so many of your acquaintance are connected.
oh, mary, said she, i wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
darcy is not to be laughed at!
my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly, to try to discover her.
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley.
pemberley was now georgiana s home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see.
collins s happiness; and that in speaking of rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too.
i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it.
elizabeth was disgusted, and even miss bennet was shocked.
collins, i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship s concurrence.
she is on her road somewhere, i dare say; and so, passing through meryton, thought she might as well call on you.
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.
she was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.
cried maria, after a few minutes silence, it seems but a day or two since we first came!
she was very equal, therefore, to address mr.
and then when we came away it was such fun!
not that i care about it, though.
can it be possible that he will marry her?
has she frightened away some of your lovers?
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte s observation, and hurried her away to her room.
this is the only point, i flatter myself, on which we do not agree.
i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.
did it, said he, did it soon make you think better of me?
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her.
say that urgent business calls us home immediately.
you are very cautious, i suppose, as to its being created?
why, jane you never dropped a word of this you sly thing!
but i cannot find out that jane saw anything of him in london.
miss lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before.
but, perhaps, his sister does as well for the present; and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.
there was too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.
we are not in a way to know what mr.
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl oh!
i am the less surprised at what has happened, replied sir william, from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.
another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment.
bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters.
my conduct may, i fear, be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter s lips instead of your own; but we are all liable to error.
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which i cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.
in a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.
we were always good friends, and now we are better.
a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern.
elizabeth s courage did not fail her.
with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms.
for if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which only genius knows.
in the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to elizabeth, said, miss eliza bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room.
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected.
you forget that i have made no answer.
she found that she was to receive no other answer; and, after a short pause, added, i think i have understood that mr.
yes, she will do for him very well.
it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man.
she had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means.
and if i had not a letter to write myself, i might sit by you, and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.
i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter!
i told my sister philips so the other day.
she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, mrs.
gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.
we neither of us perform to strangers.
miss bennet s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.
you saw me dance at meryton, i believe, sir.
he inquired in a friendly, though general, way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.
collins allowed him to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.
as to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring.
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley, yet, for elizabeth s sake, he assisted him further in his profession.
it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.
and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now.
her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.
this is the estimation in which you hold me!
how hard it is in some cases to be believed!
she could neither wonder nor condemn; but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.
i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women.
the sight of miss lucas was odious to her.
it would have suited me in every respect.
as the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park.
bennet, who assured him, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.
but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you.
darcy, the gardener s expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it.
not that i think charlotte so very plain; but then she is our particular friend.
first of all, he asked miss lucas.
my temper would perhaps be called resentful.
you have insulted me, in every possible method.
this was very amiable; but charlotte s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of: its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of mr.
and to be kept back on such a motive!
she will not be able to help calling.
bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent.
i do not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.
bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at hunsford.
pray do, my dear miss lucas, she added, in a melancholy tone; for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me; i am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves.
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while.
upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.
bingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.
collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where lady catherine, her daughter, and mrs.
if there were anyone that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.
his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and i wonder how he could presume to do it.
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion s justifying her coming so far alone.
but i ought to beg his pardon, for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant.
gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.
why, my dear, you must know, mrs.
and what arts did he use to separate them?
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week.
bennet was not in the habit of walking, mary could never spare time, but the remaining five set off together.
darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents.
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.
and with no one to speak to of what i felt, no jane to comfort me, and say that i had not been so very weak, and vain, and nonsensical, as i knew i had!
who is to fight wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?
were it for nothing but his love of you, i must always have esteemed him; but now, as bingley s friend and your husband, there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me.
perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often.
it ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason.
but really, and upon my honour, i will try to do what i think to be wisest; and now i hope you are satisfied.
kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.
bingley and jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them.
yes, thought elizabeth; that would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once.
i would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but i always speak what i think.
bennet, to walk to oakham mount this morning.
besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the shire have left meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.
bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.
at such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable.
is not there a little mistake?
but i knew i should persuade you at last.
their eyes were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall them.
we have dined nine times at rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
