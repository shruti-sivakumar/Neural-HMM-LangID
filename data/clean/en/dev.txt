cried jane, what do you mean, sir?
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man.
hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table but in vain.
with three younger sisters grown up, replied elizabeth, smiling, your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.
gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from colonel forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.
why must she be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold?
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour.
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but i was over-ruled, as i always am.
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.
his regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic.
it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.
i do not know the particulars, but i know very well that mr.
the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger.
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth s performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.
darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend.
darcy in anything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his two motives.
this roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.
of having another daughter married to mr.
pray do, my dear miss lucas, she added, in a melancholy tone; for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me; i am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves.
from that moment i observed my friend s behaviour attentively; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him.
his revenge would have been complete indeed.
my sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother s nephew, colonel fitzwilliam, and myself.
you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.
i have a warm unguarded temper, and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too freely.
indeed, mamma, you are mistaken, said elizabeth, blushing for her mother.
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire.
mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.
you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, mr.
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.
colonel fitzwilliam s manners were very much admired at the parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings.
bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.
may we take my uncle s letter to read to her?
at length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.
he is a gentleman; i am a gentleman s daughter; so far we are equal.
she coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.
it is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.
with all my heart: i will buy pemberley itself, if darcy will sell it.
and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?
i had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company.
jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or hearing from caroline.
write to me very often, my dear.
wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.
it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush.
i have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude.
darcy s sister, as, by wickham s account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.
but in the first place, he was like him; he is there alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds of prime ministers and archbishops, of metals, semi-metals, and distinguished philosophers.
gracechurch street, monday, august 2.
bennet to her daughters room, in her dressing-gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out, my dear jane, make haste and hurry down.
does he know his real character?
i always said it must be so, at last.
i am the happiest creature in the world.
bingley s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham.
always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody!
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.
they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds.
bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that, as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to longbourn.
next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.
who could about such a nasty little freckled thing?
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.
no; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called.
in essentials, i believe, he is very much what he ever was.
don t keep coughing so, kitty, for heaven s sake!
i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression.
he only told me what i have now told you.
collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon done done while mrs.
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character.
you could not make me happy, and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so.
darcy is over, i presume, said miss bingley; and pray what is the result?
long has just been here, and she told me all about it.
darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.
collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton.
he was to come there with wickham, you know.
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced.
he was then, he said, on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her.
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.
after a short survey how could i ever think her like her nephew?
yes; i do comprehend a great deal in it.
his friend had left him that morning for london, but was to return home in ten days time.
but, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if i still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.
you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him.
my mind was more agreeably engaged.
she is a very fine-looking woman!
it is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of it.
mrs bennet and her two youngest girls.
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule.
perhaps, said darcy, i should have judged better had i sought an introduction, but i am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.
your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you.
his being neither is exactly consistent with the probable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not really injured in disposition, and thoroughly in love.
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while mr.
elizabeth was disgusted, and even miss bennet was shocked.
i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies.
why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely more.
if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you.
it does seem, and it is most shocking, indeed, replied elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt.
you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all.
she directly replied, you need not be frightened.
could he expect that her friends would not step forward?
collins, and the convenient distance of hunsford from london.
darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.
bingley, i always keep servants that can do their own work; my daughters are brought up differently.
he walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great!
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr.
her liveliness had been never worse timed.
on applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.
collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement.
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being.
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that i am not afraid of requesting it, though i have still something more to ask of the former.
miss lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.
wickham immediately to elizabeth s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented.
it is evident by this, added jane, that he comes back no more this winter.
i was sometimes quite provoked; but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.
having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.
because honour, decorum, prudence nay, interest forbid it.
i never saw anyone so shocked.
bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time.
they were of a respectable family in the north of england; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.
my dear hill, have you heard the good news?
my dear charles, what do you mean?
the easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him.
i do not believe she often sees such at home.
the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person.
she is quite a little creature.
if you have not been mistaken here, i must have been in an error.
miss bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to leave her room.
from something that he told me in our journey hither, i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him.
you have a very small park here, returned lady catherine, after a short silence.
i knew you would be wishing me joy.
it is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married, continued her mother; but at the same time, mr.
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.
he begged pardon for having displeased her.
lizzy, cried her mother, remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.
they travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on the road, reached longbourn by dinnertime the next day.
i must go instantly to my mother, she cried.
she studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different.
bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered by her communication.
i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne, for fifty pounds!
collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st.
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.
the house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and lady catherine s behaviour was most friendly and obliging.
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!
your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.
but i hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.
bennet s anguish over the entail.
elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying.
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight.
in spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.
when, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr.
then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce mr.
put them next to your great-uncle the judge.
gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed; i have not an instant to lose.
how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr.
darcy was here when you sent for us; was it so?
gardiner s hope of lydia s being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance.
gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks: mrs.
philips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton.
bennet s curiosity; and elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.
bennet was not so well pleased with it.
bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party.
darcy s having both spent three weeks at rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.
i think i have heard you say that you know them.
collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where lady catherine, her daughter, and mrs.
gardiner, rendered suspicious by elizabeth s warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.
whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.
bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.
wickham ought not to be a clergyman.
a person may be proud without being vain.
i am perfectly serious in my refusal.
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.
but jane was to go home with her, and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable.
they were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something!
you are too hasty, sir, she cried.
darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister s proficiency.
but slyness seems the fashion.
yes, i call it a very easy distance.
though her manner varied, however, her determination never did.
she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.
bennet and of lady catherine de bourgh.
but not before they went to brighton?
howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs.
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage; for mr.
said miss bingley: will she be as tall as i am?
they saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.
you cannot be too much on your guard.
i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.
it was to this effect: since writing the above, dearest lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well.
to be sure, lizzy, said her aunt, he is not so handsome as wickham; or rather he has not wickham s countenance, for his features are perfectly good.
it amazes me, i confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction.
miss lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before.
i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.
said he hastily, as he opened the door.
lady catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied, the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.
let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor.
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.
very well; that reply will do for the present.
in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!
i take up my pen again to do, what i have just told you i would not; but circumstances are such, that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible.
do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer.
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr.
bennet, replied his wife, how can you be so tiresome?
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever.
why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent, said she, did he come at all?
there are, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to lady catherine de bourgh, i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.
i remember, as soon as ever i saw him, when he first came into hertfordshire last year, i thought how likely it was that you should come together.
bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial.
the housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.
this was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr.
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs.
bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, bingley, who wanted to be alone with jane, proposed their all walking out.
this is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a daughter, said elizabeth.
or had you intended any more serious consequences?
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away.
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.
miss darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place.
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting.
but now it was all too natural.
and she was only sixteen last june.
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but i hardly know what i have written.
collins will be very glad of your company, i am sure.
whatever i do is done in a hurry, replied he; and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield, i should probably be off in five minutes.
i shall walk to meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when mr.
but such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.
some acquaintance or other, my dear, i suppose; i am sure i do not know.
bennet, by talking in this way?
her not objecting does not justify him.
with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.
it should not be said, that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.
that will not do for a compliment to darcy, caroline, cried her brother, because he does not write with ease.
i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage.
he has heartily forgiven me now.
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.
my dear charlotte, impossible!
he has made me so happy, said she, one evening, by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!
intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.
elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known sir william s too long.
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.
i have more than once observed to lady catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her.
the collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, i do not know what we shall do.
they are all for what they can get.
they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon maria; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone.
but wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour.
to the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr.
oh, charlotte says she hardly ever does.
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr.
she followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held.
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said, for the present.
only this, that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me.
darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his i have not an instant to lose concern, and observe her in compassionate silence.
the gentlemen arrived early; and, before mrs.
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.
i will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.
she really looked almost wild.
darcy had voluntarily done for lydia.
she talked to elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.
bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.
bennet, said his lady to him one day, have you heard that netherfield park is let at last?
oh, lizzy, to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family!
it was in the times and the courier, i know; though it was not put in as it ought to be.
she was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.
there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping, i dare say.
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologized for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within.
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.
gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham s desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.
bennet coolly observed, from all that i can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country.
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield; and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.
here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell.
the supposition did not pain her.
lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, i dare say mr.
but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away.
lydia was lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless.
bingley s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him.
in a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.
oh, he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!
he is certainly a good brother, said elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.
she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown.
bingley s sincerity, said elizabeth warmly, but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from mrs.
there is nothing like dancing, after all.
her affections had been continually fluctuating, but never without an object.
elizabeth could not but look surprised.
but what is to be done about pemberley?
on the other hand, i, for my part, declare for pride and prejudice unhesitatingly.
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her.
he answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.
he was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.
daughters are never of so much consequence to a father.
bennet, cried his wife, what are you talking of?
this account then is what he has received from mr.
do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense?
he begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her.
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone.
though not in the least impudent and mannish grown, she has no mere sensibility, no nasty niceness about her.
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr.
i do not remember her name among the ladies at court.
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.
my faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!
not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them.
charles, when you build your house, i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley.
i was not in a humour to wait for an opening of yours.
no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr.
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.
let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor; and his inquiry to his colossal cousin as to the compliments which mr.
i will not encourage the imprudence of either, by receiving them at longbourn.
as it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents.
he is gone to my father already.
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
it was an encouragement of vice; and had i been the rector of longbourn, i should very strenuously have opposed it.
as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness.
the pause was to elizabeth s feelings dreadful.
the picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were all that remained to be shown.
miss bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room.
she talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr.
i knew, said he, that what i wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary.
bingley will not be detained in london by them.
she has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever.
the far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances.
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as i have given above.
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy.
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park, when he put his letter into her hand!
all this she must possess, added darcy; and to all she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.
wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.
not that i mean to find fault with you, for such things, i know, are all chance in this world.
the moment of her release from him was ecstasy.
i am sure there is not on his.
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas, for mr.
i know we dine with four-and-twenty families.
i believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses.
miss bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility, pray, miss eliza, are not the shire militia removed from meryton?
you begin to comprehend me, do you?
i thought we never should have got into the coach.
lydia laughed, and said, ay, that is just like your formality and discretion.
after this day, jane said no more of her indifference.
her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of mr.
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr.
norris and others have secured, i believe, a considerable party for it.
one day s delay, she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual.
however, i did not hear above one word in ten, for i was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear wickham.
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr.
the letter was to this effect: my dear lizzy, i wish you joy.
tenderly flirting had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?
what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here?
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her.
it ought to be good, he replied: it has been the work of many generations.
your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.
but at least it shows that she was serious in the object of her journey.
bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.
i would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but i always speak what i think.
why did not you seek legal redress?
lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, i could not rest till i knew the particulars.
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them, for mr.
gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself.
but you forget, mamma, said elizabeth, that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that mrs.
i can hardly write for laughing.
at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.
you must send john with the young ladies, mrs.
gardiner could not but be deeply affected.
his appearance was greatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.
persuasion, relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling in interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite delicacy and keeping.
i have told miss bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though mrs.
nay, said elizabeth, this is not fair.
elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs together.
the girls stared at their father.
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?
collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for mrs.
all that i can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry.
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quietly at longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes.
but these, i suppose, are precisely what you are without.
it is very interesting that we possess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled first draught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in john dashwood.
elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from pemberley.
my dear eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way.
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his information.
f.; but no one can throw any blame on them.
he inquired in a friendly, though general, way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.
darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.
i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.
bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth.
i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had.
ten thousand a year, and very likely more!
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.
four weeks passed away, and jane saw nothing of him.
a thorough, determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.
there was no arguing upon such a project.
be assured, my dear sir, that mrs.
can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?
is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?
gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.
bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said, but is there not danger of lady catherine s disapprobation here, my good sir?
but i have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world.
no, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if i have very good luck, i may meet with another mr.
yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.
charlotte s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth.
and upon elizabeth s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added, lizzy, i insist upon your staying and hearing mr.
if he does not come to me, then, said she, i shall give him up for ever.
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.
hurst thought the same, and added, she has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker.
bingley, she could not make a very favourable answer.
can he be a sensible man, sir?
other schemes, too, came into her head.
hurst began again, i have an excessive regard for jane bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and i wish with all my heart she were well settled.
oh, if that is all, i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better.
to me this humour seems to possess a greater affinity, on the whole, to that of addison than to any other of the numerous species of this great british genus.
darcy s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home.
my dear madam, replied he, let us be for ever silent on this point.
it was greatly my wish that he should do so, he added, as soon as his marriage was fixed on.
darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder; and when at last mr.
he did not talk to me of his own arts, said fitzwilliam, smiling.
your picture may be very exact, louisa, said bingley; but this was all lost upon me.
when at length they arose to take leave, mrs.
bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr.
bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.
delighted to see their dear friend again.
it is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.
darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.
it was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return.
i am not afraid of you, said he, smilingly.
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.
is not there a little mistake?
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder.
pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before.
she blushed, and jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.
i knew how it would be i knew he would manage everything.
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion.
and i certainly never shall give it.
elizabeth bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, mr.
oh, my dear, cried his wife, i cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
darcy that they scarcely ever saw him.
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs.
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could.
my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better.
nonsense, how can you talk so!
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.
if he wants our society, let him seek it.
we may as well leave them by themselves, you know, said her mother as soon as she was in the hall.
when i am in the country, he replied, i never wish to leave it; and when i am in town, it is pretty much the same.
could he, or the lucases, have pitched on any man, within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related?
don t think me angry, however, for i only mean to let you know, that i had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your side.
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.
bennet began repeating her thanks to mr.
this is a parade, cried he, which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune!
i know little of the game at present, said he, but i shall be glad to improve myself; for in my situation of life mrs.
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent?
gardiner, and miss bennet, to dinner at pemberley, before they left the country.
yet now i must believe you, cried jane.
my dear lizzy, you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.
everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.
bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was mrs.
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.
elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation.
elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily settled.
what do you think has happened this morning?
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr.
he takes them now for people of fashion.
bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother.
there is also one other person in the party, he continued after a pause, who more particularly wishes to be known to you.
i can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away.
with proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.
but to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.
what congratulations will then flow in!
elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.
let me write for you, said jane, if you dislike the trouble yourself.
i have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.
oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both.
i do not mind his not talking to mrs.
gardiner, i begin to be of your uncle s opinion.
for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter.
her heart did whisper that he had done it for her.
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield.
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and mr.
she was very wrong in singling me out as she did; i can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on her side.
hurst and once with miss bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
collins has made you an offer of marriage.
if i may so express it, he has a right to be proud.
not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the pemberley house, is a powerful motive.
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again.
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen him.
when i have a house of my own, i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library.
it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world.
and for this we are to be thankful.
this young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the heart of mortal can most desire, splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage.
you must, therefore, allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform what i look on as a point of duty.
but, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy, who had been set up as a rival to jane.
this letter gave elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned, as she considered that jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
they have at least that advantage.
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and mrs.
of the lady s sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.
i do, indeed, replied elizabeth, colouring.
i never saw such a long chin in my life.
elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased.
but her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came.
bennet said only, nonsense, nonsense!
this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret.
wickham; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday, saturday, sunday, and monday endurable to kitty and lydia.
with many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter, to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for mrs.
it ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason.
