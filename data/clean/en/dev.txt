he shall not be in love with me, if i can prevent it.
you need not distress yourself.
i must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married.
you have sense, and we all expect you to use it.
she was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its being mr.
you see on what a footing we are.
said elizabeth; but the terms, i suppose, must be complied with.
his countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips.
hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was very glad; but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley s salutation.
the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first.
daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and mrs.
i shall never forget her appearance this morning.
she was going to the butcher s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.
when they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give.
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?
she talked to elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.
bingley was by no means deficient; but darcy was clever.
darcy, that you hardly ever forgave; that your resentment, once created, was unappeasable.
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her, and, with an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her, so, miss eliza, i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham?
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort.
elizabeth immediately began playing again.
my father began life in the profession which your uncle, mr.
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.
accompanied by a violent yawn.
what do you think has happened this morning?
i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw, in common with others, that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country.
regard for my sister s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but i wrote to mr.
after this period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped.
i have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very superior dancing is not often seen.
why did not you seek legal redress?
when i am in the country, he replied, i never wish to leave it; and when i am in town, it is pretty much the same.
there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister s frailty would have mortified her so much.
it is impossible for me to be impartial.
what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?
you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them.
do your sisters play and sing?
at length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of elizabeth after the health of her family.
her mother s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much.
their conduct has been such, replied elizabeth, as neither you, nor i, nor anybody, can ever forget.
she was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprang.
he is a gentleman; i am a gentleman s daughter; so far we are equal.
she coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.
he leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place.
my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them; by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.
at night she opened her heart to jane.
the house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and lady catherine s behaviour was most friendly and obliging.
not these two or three years, perhaps.
you may remember what i told you on that point, when first we talked of it.
what will be his surprise, thought she, when he knows who they are!
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father.
this letter gave elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned, as she considered that jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
indeed, fantastic as it may seem, i should put miss austen as near to swift in some ways, as i have put her to addison in others.
what is there of good to be expected?
he still loves me, and we are engaged.
kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such a step.
i always said it must be so, at last.
i am the happiest creature in the world.
delighted to see their dear friend again.
with great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic.
assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable.
bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom.
the recollection of what i then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.
i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression.
darcy give you his reasons for this interference?
bennet, and prepared for backgammon.
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was mrs.
i am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.
it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.
darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.
collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off.
but, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.
cried elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves.
this was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.
long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.
after a short survey how could i ever think her like her nephew?
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.
when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication.
it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr.
you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns, said darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.
you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner, in such society; and, indeed, i am quite of your opinion.
she is a very fine-looking woman!
could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to colonel forster?
jones s being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians.
repeated darcy, contemptuously, yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed.
darcy, you cannot deny the fact.
your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you.
it has sometimes, i believe, been urged that his pride is unnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding, while his falling in love at all is not extremely probable.
miss bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility, pray, miss eliza, are not the shire militia removed from meryton?
lydia s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room.
on miss lucas s persevering, however, she added, very well; if it must be so, it must.
why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely more.
if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you.
wickham will never marry a woman without some money.
you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all.
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy.
and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth?
protested he must be entirely mistaken.
if you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence.
what an agreeable man sir william is, mr.
bennet protested against any description of finery.
darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what mr.
elizabeth s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr.
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.
but her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy mr.
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder.
kitty, run down and order the carriage.
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.
it is unlucky, said she, after a short pause, that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country.
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.
tenderly flirting had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?
because honour, decorum, prudence nay, interest forbid it.
cried elizabeth when she had finished it.
bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time.
their manners are not equal to his.
and as i come back, i can call on lady lucas and mrs.
such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished for her age!
bennet, as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.
they found mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to.
her reflections were in general satisfactory.
make haste, and come down this moment.
but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.
darcy said very little, and mr.
oh yes, said elizabeth drily mr.
you have a very small park here, returned lady catherine, after a short silence.
how long has she been such a favourite?
the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune!
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.
bennet s heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.
cried he, turning towards her.
i can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away.
i must go instantly to my mother, she cried.
i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things.
she would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out, as she entered the library, oh, mr.
this is a parade, cried he, which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune!
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.
for heaven s sake, madam, speak lower.
indeed, eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them.
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!
to be sure you know no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love.
you have no compassion on my poor nerves.
austen leigh has given us, in dooming her privately to marry one of mr.
miss eliza bennet, said miss bingley, despises cards.
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight.
here, sarah, come to miss bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.
lady catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.
i do not cough for my own amusement, replied kitty, fretfully.
and, if i may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses.
i take up my pen again to do, what i have just told you i would not; but circumstances are such, that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible.
one may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.
gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power.
mary and kitty were both with mrs.
and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother?
no, no, you shall not deceive me: i know it to be impossible.
bennet s curiosity; and elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.
they will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to longbourn; and i understand from mrs.
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.
lydia s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband s never intending to go there himself.
young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage; and if she has the true darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.
every park has its beauty and its prospects; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as mr.
the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn; and what with the philipses, the lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement.
vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another.
bennet began repeating her thanks to mr.
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.
if i may so express it, he has a right to be proud.
i am not now to learn, replied mr.
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.
elizabeth privately added, and how much i shall have to conceal!
they called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt.
they entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.
this has been my motive, my fair cousin, and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.
if i had ever learnt, i should have been a great proficient.
will you be very angry with me, my dear lizzy, if i take this opportunity of saying (what i was never bold enough to say before) how much i like him?
it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends.
first, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and, secondly, of my room.
she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.
the formality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait is only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural.
i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage, because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right.
no arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be, of all others, most afflicting to a parent s mind.
their other engagements were few, as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses reach.
upon my word, caroline, i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation.
but she had no reason to fear mr.
they were all astonished; and mr.
it was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.
gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece s beginning the subject.
i can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, i have seen nothing of it.
my aunt told me so herself on saturday.
as for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin elizabeth.
much more rational, my dear caroline, i dare say; but it would not be near so much like a ball.
said he hastily, as he opened the door.
lady catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied, the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband.
perhaps that is not possible for anyone.
he replied, and was again silent.
the others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his figure; but elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence.
gardiner s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.
could she exert herself, it would be better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, i never in my life saw him so affected.
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine, and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer; and i have inquired of everybody, too, who is likely to know.
darcy s explanation, by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what jane had lost.
morris immediately; that he is to take possession before michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.
darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light.
why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent, said she, did he come at all?
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and mr.
i remember, as soon as ever i saw him, when he first came into hertfordshire last year, i thought how likely it was that you should come together.
the family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive them.
they were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something!
darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend s inclination; or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy.
the party did not supply much conversation.
bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, bingley, who wanted to be alone with jane, proposed their all walking out.
the loss of her daughter made mrs.
or had you intended any more serious consequences?
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away.
hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.
but her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came.
how strange must it appear to him!
be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what lydia s infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business.
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr.
my dear lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us.
they were excessively sorry to go!
you have a sweet room here, mr.
kitty stared at him, and lydia exclaimed.
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night.
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.
your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr.
if it were not allowable for him to gain my affections, because i had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?
elizabeth, immediately recognizing the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she expected.
i should infinitely prefer a book.
at present i have not room to do them justice.
i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount, and elizabeth silently consented.
he has heartily forgiven me now.
there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter which promises well.
with proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.
he has made me so happy, said she, one evening, by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!
i never heard anything so abominable.
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time, and the plan became as perfect as plan could be.
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.
but she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight?
collins s wife by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness.
they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon maria; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone.
darcy was here when you sent for us; was it so?
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.
jenkinson, who lives with them.
wickham, i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family.
she followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held.
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said, for the present.
only this, that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me.
no, i thank you, she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.
the gentlemen arrived early; and, before mrs.
bennet s schemes for this day were ineffectual.
she was very wrong in singling me out as she did; i can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on her side.
when dinner was over, she returned directly to jane, and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.
darcy had voluntarily done for lydia.
my dear, replied her husband, i have two small favours to request.
i certainly have had my share of beauty, but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.
their names are, in chronological order, elizabeth bennet, diana vernon, argemone lavington, beatrix esmond, and barbara grant.
oh, lizzy, to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family!
people did say, you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas; but, however, i hope it is not true.
with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.
well, well, i only hope it will last.
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth s performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.
you alluded to something else.
it was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon.
philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before.
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield; and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.
with respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured mr.
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the pianoforte, and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.
bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.
you cannot be too much on your guard.
bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial.
there is a gentleman with him, mamma, said kitty; who can it be?
they contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.
oh, he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!
to my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.
she was confident of having performed her duty; and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.
this account then is what he has received from mr.
her liveliness had been never worse timed.
when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short.
if my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.
surprise was the least of all her feelings on this development.
about a month, said elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, he is a man of very large property in derbyshire, i understand.
not lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, mr.
and in the sect fairly large and yet unusually choice of austenians or janites, there would probably be found partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the novels.
darcy; and you, yourself, when last at longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him.
our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character.
there can be no occasion for your going so soon.
bennet, cried his wife, what are you talking of?
darcy than he has received; and i am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his sister s, mr.
long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, i will take it on myself.
he had never before supposed that, could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement.
as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer.
elizabeth of course belongs to the allegro or allegra division of the army of venus.
she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr.
bennet, shaking her head, then she is better off than many girls.
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs.
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule.
bennet could hardly comprehend it.
it ought to be good, he replied: it has been the work of many generations.
i was not in a humour to wait for an opening of yours.
no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr.
as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness.
darcy, and even miss elizabeth herself, were, i am inclined to think, rather hard on him for the impropriety of his conduct.
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained.
i am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection.
he is gone to my father already.
and this, cried darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, is your opinion of me!
it was an encouragement of vice; and had i been the rector of longbourn, i should very strenuously have opposed it.
perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.
the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation.
reynolds anticipated miss darcy s delight, when she should enter the room.
when i have a house of my own, i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library.
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking.
i knew, said he, that what i wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary.
when they had gained their own room, jane, taking out her letter, said, this is from caroline bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal.
it cannot be concealed from anyone.
i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match, cried elizabeth.
they battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.
he answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.
and his behaviour, so strikingly altered, what could it mean?
nor i, i am sure, said miss bingley.
no aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; the very shoe-roses for netherfield were got by proxy.
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but mrs.
attention, forbearance, patience with darcy, was injury to wickham.
she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool; gone to stay.
in the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that mr.
but that gentleman, looking at darcy, seemed to think the country was nothing at all.
i believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses.
while thus engaged, elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr.
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry, i hope, though you have but a short lease.
bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did mr.
brighton and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of meryton!
after this day, jane said no more of her indifference.
her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of mr.
how merry we shall be together when we meet!
this distinction applies to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it brings a curious consequence with it.
in a short time, i shall have a daughter married.
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church.
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged mr.
the letter was to this effect: my dear lizzy, i wish you joy.
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility.
bingley is most unaffectedly modest.
as all conversation was thereby at an end, elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.
and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but i am an idle fellow; and though i have not many, i have more than i ever looked into.
come, darcy, said he, i must have you dance.
your affectionate friend, lydia bennet.
i must be in town next saturday.
oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.
i cannot do justice to his kindness.
lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, i could not rest till i knew the particulars.
collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane, in order to have the gentlemen accompanied him.
she was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.
it was then disclosed in the following manner.
these were the contents: my dear harriet, you will laugh when you know where i am gone, and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as i am missed.
at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.
when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer, i made a point of her having two men-servants go with her.
her affections had been continually fluctuating, but never without an object.
denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed.
walt whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between loving by allowance and loving with personal love.
i assure you, madam, he replied, that she does not need such advice.
my dear jane, exclaimed elizabeth, you are too good.
they went to the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her.
a fortnight s acquaintance is certainly very little.
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.
wickham; no, i certainly am not.
i shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.
what a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!
the wisest and best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions, may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke.
it has been said that no one ever was like him.
the coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to longbourn.
the tête-à-tête surprised them.
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of mr.
the farewell between herself and mr.
after making every possible inquiry on that side of london, colonel f.
miss darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful.
collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and mr.
i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.
bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth.
i hope she will turn out well.
ten thousand a year, and very likely more!
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business.
i dare say i shall soon see them here.
till i can forget his father, i can never defy or expose him.
collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to lady lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.
the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning s impatience.
if from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest, for dishonesty i must call it.
is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?
sure he will not leave london before he has found them.
collins, when he returned to longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.
that he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.
i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.
i am astonished, my dear, said mrs.
collins has made an offer to lizzy, and she will not have him.
come, kitty, i want you upstairs.
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage.
what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here?
darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for mr.
when the clock struck three, elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so.
he must be an oddity, i think, said she.
and she was only sixteen last june.
it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing, said bingley.
well, cried elizabeth, have it as you choose.
all the minor passages the loves of jane and bingley, the advent of mr.
under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.
collins and me have a little conversation together.
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.
darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance.
and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley.
very nonsensical to come at all!
bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other.
her mind was less difficult to develope.
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for mr.
she could think of nothing but of mr.
darcy could be so unworthy of mr.
her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself.
every kind of pride must revolt from the connection.
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others.
after lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that mr.
my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, eliza, said charlotte.
i grieve to find, however, that colonel f.
pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before.
the easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him.
to know that her daughter would be married was enough.
collins s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair.
and i certainly never shall give it.
hurst and once with miss bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
i must speak to hill this moment.
i did not think caroline in spirits, were her words, but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london.
collins, who was complimenting mr.
darcy had been at her sister s wedding.
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission; jane certainly could not come back.
what a fine thing for our girls!
it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single.
you forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if i went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.
what do you keep winking at me for?
bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.
could he, or the lucases, have pitched on any man, within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related?
those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.
she would not betray her trust, i suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.
everything nourishes what is strong already.
and lydia used to want to go to london, added kitty.
with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr.
how should you have liked making sermons?
there was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.
yet now i must believe you, cried jane.
i know my own strength, and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming.
she shared in their attendance on mrs.
ah, you do not know what i suffer.
miss bingley is to live with her brother, and keep his house; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her.
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too much.
collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary.
though lydia had never been a favourite with them, mr.
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way.
they can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it.
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends.
the idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them.
if my children are silly, i must hope to be always sensible of it.
they will join me early to-morrow, he continued, and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you, mr.
forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.
you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness.
i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did.
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving mr.
they had long wished to see him.
and have you answered the letter?
i have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.
dear lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.
i do not believe a word of it, my dear.
could he expect that her friends would not step forward?
she answered him in the usual way; and, after a moment s pause, added, my eldest sister has been in town these three months.
the children have been wanting me this half hour.
i would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after.
but, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if i still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr.
tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.
another time, lizzy, said her mother, i would not dance with him, if i were you.
but we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride.
you must not be too severe upon yourself, replied elizabeth.
but it ended in nothing, and i will not be sent on a fool s errand again.
seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman s concurrence.
darcy s progress through his book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.
it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world.
bennet made no answer; and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house.
the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly.
i believe him to be lady catherine s nephew.
bingley was ready, georgiana was eager, and darcy determined, to be pleased.
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty.
it does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.
he seldom appeared really animated.
gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself.
but jane knows, as well as i do, what wickham really is.
jane and elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay.
there is also one other person in the party, he continued after a pause, who more particularly wishes to be known to you.
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of mr.
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.
and of this place, thought she, i might have been mistress!
elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply.
collins s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted.
