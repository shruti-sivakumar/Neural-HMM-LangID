üß† NeuralHMM: Neural Hidden Markov Model
----------------------------------------

### Overview

**NeuralHMM** is a hybrid probabilistic-deep learning model that combines the classical **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** with the representation learning power of **neural networks**. It retains the interpretability of HMMs while benefiting from the expressiveness and flexibility of neural models.

This approach enables learning **transition** and **emission** probabilities through parameterized neural networks, allowing for greater adaptability to complex, high-dimensional, and non-linear data patterns compared to traditional HMMs.

### üîç Why NeuralHMM?

Traditional HMMs work well for structured sequence data with discrete latent variables and simple emission distributions (e.g., Gaussian, categorical). However, they struggle with:

*   High-dimensional input (e.g., images, audio, embeddings)
    
*   Non-linear relationships
    
*   Lack of representational power
    

**NeuralHMM addresses this by:**

*   Using neural networks to parameterize emission or transition probabilities
    
*   Retaining latent variable modeling and sequence structure
    
*   Providing a scalable and expressive architecture for sequence modeling
    

### üß© Components

#### 1\. **Hidden States (Z)**

*   As in classical HMMs, a discrete latent variable z\_t at each time step governs the observed data.
    
*   The transition dynamics between hidden states remain Markovian (i.e., z\_t depends only on z\_{t-1}).
    

#### 2\. **Transition Model**

*   Defines P(z\_t | z\_{t-1}), the probability of moving from one hidden state to another.
    
*   In NeuralHMM, this can be **learned using a neural network**, e.g., an MLP that outputs a transition matrix.
    

transition_logits = NeuralTransitionNet(z_{t-1})  P(z_t | z_{t-1}) = softmax(transition_logits)   `

#### 3\. **Emission Model**

*   Defines P(x\_t | z\_t), the probability of observing x\_t given the current hidden state z\_t.
    
*   Neural networks (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer, etc.) are used to **parameterize complex emission distributions**.
    


#### 4\. **Inference**

*   Since exact posterior inference over hidden states is often intractable in NeuralHMM, **variational inference** (e.g., amortized inference with an inference network) or **forward-backward algorithms** are adapted.
    
*   You may use **ELBO (Evidence Lower Bound)** optimization to train the model.
    

### üõ†Ô∏è Training Objective

The model is trained by maximizing the **log-likelihood** of the observed sequence X = {x\_1, ..., x\_T}:

log‚Å°P(X)=log‚Å°‚àëZP(X,Z)\\log P(X) = \\log \\sum\_{Z} P(X, Z)

Or via the **ELBO** using a variational posterior Q(Z|X):

LELBO=EQ(Z‚à£X)\[log‚Å°P(X‚à£Z)\]‚àíKL\[Q(Z‚à£X)‚à£‚à£P(Z)\]\\mathcal{L}\_{ELBO} = \\mathbb{E}\_{Q(Z|X)}\[\\log P(X|Z)\] - KL\[Q(Z|X) || P(Z)\]

### üöÄ Applications

NeuralHMMs are useful in domains where sequence modeling is essential and structured latent variables are beneficial:

*   Speech recognition
    
*   Part-of-speech tagging
    
*   DNA/RNA sequence modeling
    
*   Music generation
    
*   Time-series segmentation
    
*   Behavior modeling in robotics
